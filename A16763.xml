         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>It is not good</hi> (ſaith the wiſe king) <hi>to regard the face</hi> (that is, the perſon of any man) <hi>in iudgement.</hi> The reaſons follow.</p>

            <p>The which Sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces do briefly &amp; very pithily giue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe two things: firſt how great vprightnes ought to be in all Princes, Iudges and Rulers, to the end they may
<pb facs="tcp:12614:3"/> iudge righteous iudgement: ſecondly, how great the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is, which by the ſentence of God himſelf, doth belong to all ſuch; namely, that they ſhall be a ioy to the people of God, that the people again ſhal reuerence the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that God wil heare their prayers for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They ſhew alſo herewithal, that on the contrarie, ſuch as take an vniuſt courſe, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and diſhonour, yea vengeance due vnto them.</p>
            <p>So gratiouſly is the God of righteouſneſſe inclined and bent toward his righteous ſeruants; and ſo wrathfully is he ſetled in his iudgement and decree againſt the reſt.</p>
            <p>But leauing to treate of the dutie of the Magiſtrate and Gouernour, which is not the preſent purpoſe: may it pleaſe your Honour, to giue one poore Miniſter of the word of God, in the name of manie, who by the grace of God haue care of our own bounden dutie; your fauorable good leaue, in regarde of the premiſes, to teſtifie that great ioy which we haue by you, and that reuerend eſtimation which we haue of you, with harty deſire of all increaſe of Gods beſt graces and bleſſings vpon you, &amp; the reſt of our good Gouernours vnder her Highneſſe; becauſe of that care of vprightneſſe of iudgement, wherewith God of his mercie hath honoured and graced you in the ſight of vs all, to the ſenſible and publike benefite of all: ſeeing (as it is euident from the holy ſentences before rehearſed) it is the will and pleaſure of God, that we of dutie ſhould ſo do. And the rather alſo, becauſe we perceiue that mercie is linked with iuſtice, in your gratious and currant proceedings; the which we know from the booke of God, to be effectuall to helpe ſingularly, to the eſtabliſhing of the honour &amp; peace of the throne of our moſt gracious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe royall ſouereigntie through her whole dominions, we humbly beſeech God of his infinite mercy, euen for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts ſake, long and happily to continue and aduance among vs. Amen.</p>
            <p>Such (right Honorable, our very good Lord) is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall purpoſe of the preſent writing, but yet ſo as the more
<pb facs="tcp:12614:3"/> particular intent, is to teſtifie the late increaſe of our ioy, reuerend eſtimation, &amp; humble prayer with hartie thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God for you, &amp; all other our good &amp; godly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, vnder her Maieſtie; as alſo the increraſe of our hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; harty thankfulnes to you and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to her gratious Maieſtie eſpecially, euen for the late point of ſo great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull iuſtice, which you haue eſtabliſhed and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among vs, to the ſingular glorie of God, honor of your gouernment, and comfort of all well-diſpoſed ſubiects, in that you haue ſuppreſſed the vagabond life of a moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vnprofitable, yea a moſt dangerous and harmeful ſort of people: the which being of too ancient breede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, were of late yeeres ſo mightily increaſed, that by their licencious and vniuſt, yea verie ſturdy and ſhameleſſe vagring and begging, all mercie of almes-giuing was ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently catched vp and deuoured at euery rich mans gate, and alſo at euery meane mans doore, that mercie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, to the cruell and waſtfull feeding and foſtering of ſuch an idle and wicked rout, as by the rule of the holy Apoſtle, were altogether vnworthy of any almes, in ſo much as they were ſuch, as vtterly refuſed to work. And be ſides, in vaine confidence and proud preſumption of an imagined preſcription of time, at the firſt mention of their reſtraint, they feared not, at our dores, to ſpeake contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and skornfully of ſo holy a purpoſe, as if it had bene an impoſſible thing, that rogues ſhold haue abiding places, and that beggers ſhould liue of their labours.</p>
            <p>But thankes be to God, to her Maieſty, and to you: this excellent point of mercifull iuſtice, was no ſooner aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and authoriſed by gratious Statute wiſely penned, and enacted by high Court of Parliament, to the ſame effect and purpoſe; but it hath ſo proſperouſly, and with ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſucceſſe preuailed, that God hath, to the great comfort of all that loue true iudgement &amp; mercie, ſhewed euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his good hand went with the execution of it, as no doubt his good Spirit was formerly preſident in that holy
<pb facs="tcp:12614:4"/> conſultation and aduiſe, which was taken about it.</p>
            <p>The which one Act (right Honorable) how many good acts it hath wrought, highly to the honour of God, and her Maieſtie, and the whole gouernment; and alſo, how good &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious it is to the publike weale of the whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a long narration would hardly ſuffice worthily to declare. O how much filthineſſe of adulterie and fornication, of the vagabonds themſelues, is hereby cut off, which was wont in more then brutiſh maner, to be practiſed in all places of their confuſed lodging together, at euery Faire and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket through the land, after they had filled themſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ues with the fatteſt of the roſt, and drunke themſelues drunken with the ſtrongeſt of the Beere that their Hoſteſſe could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them, for that which they had partly begged and partly ſtollen the ſame day! What a cloake and couert of much baſtardize, practiſed by the rogues bad-good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, miſtreſſes, &amp; dames, is hereby taken away; ſeeing they ſhal henceforth no more cary about the baſe-born, to hide them in farre remoued places, or to leade them about, as their owne naturall children, as many of them were wont to do! How are not only the diſordered births, but alſo the vntimely deaths, of many young infants, preuented; the liues whereof (though the fruite of their owne bodies) this mercileſſe and ſauage people little regarded! How grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly is the man-ſtealing of ſome proper children, with the intollerable miſuſage and disfiguring of them, hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, ſo that their cruell and vnnaturall practiſes, ſhall no more abuſe the pitie of others by begging with them! Who knoweth howe manie priuate perſons ſhall bee hereby ſafegarded from robberies and pilferies; yea and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace, from dangerous mutinies &amp; rebellions, by ſuch euil inſtruments (I mean counterfeit ſouldiers) as were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into that rude faction? In al theſe things, how are the ſoules of ſuch miſerable and forlorne ſinners, tendered and plucked out of the diuels iawes, as we may ſay; in that the moſt abominable courſe of their life is dammed or hedged
<pb facs="tcp:12614:4"/> vp, if happily they may at the laſt, held by due correction, in a more orderly conuerſation, be brought to repentance, as there is hope that God wil giue many that grace! To ſpeak the ſum of al in few words; how happily are a moſt lawleſſe &amp; lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tious multitude, whch by their wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering diſorder of life, eluded all law, brought within the iuſt limits &amp; diſciplin of lawe; yea ſuch a monſtrous and ſottiſh multitude, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regarded Church nor common wealth, neither God nor Prince, neither word, prayer, ſacrament, nor mariage, neither wife, nor child, nor any honeſt labour, either tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching themſelues, or for the education of their adulterous off-ſpring: but liued, and delighted themſelues in a moſt barbarous and beaſtly confuſion, to the multiplying of a moſt vile generation! And how is the whole land it ſelfe, &amp; the ſacred ſeat of iuſtice, disburthened of that guiltineſſe and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of Gods wrath, which might in ſhort ſpace haue growne, now at the laſt, by ouer long ſufferance: ſeeing ſo great and foule euils, would certainly haue cried to heauen with a loud and ſhrill voyce for vengeance; if they had not thus tempeſtiuely, by the power of lawfull authoritie, and by the godly care and remorſe of our Magiſtrates, bene made as it were dumbe and ſpeachleſſe before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of God!</p>
            <p>And now alſo, yet further then all this, by the deniall of diſordered ſuccour, or toleration to the idle and vagrant; ô how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly may poore labouring houſholders, and vncounterfeit impotent and aged people, yea many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands both of yong and olde, ſuch as ſhall be found to need reliefe, be, by that vncomfortable and waſte charge, which was euen caſt away in that former courſe of giuing, now relieued and cheriſhed in their honeſt &amp; lawfull trade of life, to the great glory of God, &amp; to the ſingular bleſſing of the whole land; if happily according to the good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes, and liberties authoriſed to the ſame end, by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Statute and explanations thereof, the prouiſion for the poore ſhall be with a liberall heart, and with a wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet

            <p>But who (as was ſaid) can ſufficientlie, without a large diſcourſe lay forth the worthie partes, of this ſo noble and princelie an Act; which ſhall ſtand for euer in record, for a bleſſed memoriall of the right godlie wiſedome and care of our gratious Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and of all the worthies of the high court of Parliament; and namelie, of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this behalfe, among all other worthie Acts? Verily, more &amp; greater good, both to our ſelues &amp; to all poſterity, through the gratious bleſſing of our God, wil grow from it, then eaſilie can of the wiſeſt be conceiued; if the iuſtice herein preſcribed, beeing ſtill purſued and practiſed as there is good hope it ſhal; mercie alſo, and liberality, which is likewiſe therin intended, and commanded, may be ready to acompany and ſupport iuſtice, according to the mindes of the Law-makers. That is to ſay; if, as all loitering drones and lubbers be forbidden to be fatted abroad, ſo no diligent Bee or painefull Labourer be ſuffered for want of neceſſary reliefe toward his ouer great family &amp; charge of children, ſpecially in time of ſickneſſe, or in old age, or in times of dearth, be ſuffered, as it were in the hardneſſe of winter, when no flowers can be found, to pine away and

            <head>A Treatiſe of Chriſtian beneficence, <hi>and of that like Chriſtian</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe which is due to the ſame.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing the whole argument of this our intended Treatiſe, is called by the Apoſtle Paule, <hi>The matter of Giuing and Receiuing,</hi> Philip. 4.15. by a ſimilitude borrowed from the vſe of books of Account, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is diligently entred, and kept in record, what each party hath from time to time deliuered or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the one from the other, till the day of reckening doe come. We will therefore, according to the ſame his holy direction, ſpeake of it, vnder thoſe plaine and familiar termes; following alſo therein, the ſame his order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, concerning the parts or branches thereof.</p>
            <p>In the former part, which is of <hi>giuing giftes or benefites,</hi> indeuouring as great plainneſſe as we can, we will in the firſt place, conſider what <hi>giuing</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, what ſundrie vertues are required to the right manner of <hi>Giuing,</hi> and therwithall on the contrarie, what be the vices which do either altogether hinder, or at the leaſt corrupt the ſame, if they be not ſhunned &amp; auoided.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, what is the reward of right chriſtian giuing.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, what the puniſhment of illiberalitie and not Giuing is.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, certaine anſwers ſhall be made, to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, as Satan and mans owne corrupt &amp; couetous, or diſtruſtful and vnbeteeming affection, do mightilie ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12614:8"/> to the hinderance of holie beneficence; yea euen to the vtter ſuppreſſing of it, if poſſiblie the Deuill could atchieue &amp; winne the ſame. This ſhall be the order and contentes of the firſt part of our Treatiſe, concerning <hi>Giuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter part, which is of Receiuing gifts or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites; we will likewiſe, in as plaine an order &amp; maner as we can attaine vnto, declare firſt, what that <hi>Receiuing</hi> is whereof we ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, what graces or vertues are requiſite to the right maner of <hi>Receiuing</hi> gifts and benefits, and there with alſo, which be the contrarie vices.</p>
            <p>And in the third place, we purpoſe to ſhew the greatnes of the ſin of vnthankfulnes; and accordinglie, how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhment belongeth to all vnthankful &amp; irreligous <hi>Receiuers;</hi> whoſoeuer they be, that ſhall vnchriſtianly waſt &amp; conſume that which is chriſtianlie giuen, &amp; beſtowed vpon them.</p>
            <p>Finallie, we will adde a certaine <hi>Florilegie</hi> (if we may ſo call it) that is, a collection of choiſe ſentences out of the beſt ſorte of writers both former &amp; latter, chriſtian and philoſophicall, ſuch as God vſed among the heathen to cheriſh that light of naturall vnderſtanding, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of humane office and dutie, which he would haue preſerued in the middeſt of them: and ſuch alſo as he hath vſed for his more holie and honorable inſtruments for the direction and inſtigation of his people from time to time, to walke not onelie in humanitie, but euen in Chriſtian mercie &amp; compaſſion toward their brethren, in a holie communion of Saintes before him. Not for neceſſitie of proofe or for power of perſwaſion, as if the holie Scriptures were not alone ſufficient to euerie holie vſe, both of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, reprehenſion, comfort and exhortation: but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, that wil not ſhut his eyes, may more clearely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that he ſhall ſtand euery way conuict, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before God, and in his owne conſcience, and before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12614:8"/> the world, if he do not mind and practiſe the duties herein conteined. And that eſpecially, in more then ordinary hard times, ſuch as of late haue continued for ſundry yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and are like againe to renew vpon vs, if we call not the more earneſtly vpon God for mercie, and if we ſhall not more vnfeinedly repent of our moſt grieuous ſinnes, which haue, as it were, armed his iuſtice, and kindled his wrath againſt vs. And in this reſpect, I truſt, ſuch addition of ſentences ſhall not be vngratefully accepted, either of the learned, who will take an honeſt and ſcholler-like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the elegancie of the ſpeech, wherein the Authours expreſſe their graue and weightie meditations of theſe matters: or of the vnlearned, for whoſe ſake I will Engliſh at the leaſt the more briefe and principall of them. And the rather haue I this truſt, becauſe they will wiſely conſider, that there is more libertie allowable this way, in a courſe of writing, then in an vſuall order and cuſtome of preaching: and againe, becauſe in no other argument may this be to better purpoſe performed, then in that which is preſently in hand.</p>

Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore ſtrongly chalengeth, that we begin with Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as with the principall and more worthy part of that Prize, which now is ſtriuen for.</p>
               <p>And how, I pray you, ſhould it not be as the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth from the doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt, that Giuing is a more bleſſed thing than Receiuing; ſeeing that by how much men of God, are more bountifully minded, and more liberally handed; by ſo much do they more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both in diſpoſition of mind, &amp; alſo in practiſe of Action,

This doubt the Lord himſelfe giueth clearely to vnderſtand in his holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where he hath of purpoſe moſt fully reuealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; in that he holdeth forth the light of his mercy, to ſhine out moſt brightly among the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of his moſt noble &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vertues; as we may perceiue by a few teſtimonies cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of many, which it ſhall be good for vs to alleadge, before we proceed any further, as it were out of ſo warme a Sun-ſhine. The Prophet Moſes telleth vs, that at what time it pleaſed God, at his requeſt, to proclaime the glorie of his name, Exod. chap. 34. verſes 6.7. that he vſed more words in number, and larger in ſence, to expreſſe his mercy then any diuine property els: yea then the wrath of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which is there mentioned with it. The words of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which exceed in number are theſe: <hi>Mercifull, gratious, ſlowe to anger, and aboundant in goodneſſe and truth;</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with, <hi>not making the wicked innocent,</hi> and <hi>viſiting of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> foure or fiue to two. The words which exceed in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſence are theſe, <hi>Reſeruing mercy for thouſands, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iniquity, &amp; tranſgreſſion, and ſin;</hi> that is, infinit ſinnes, and all kind of great and grieuous ſinnes; compared with theſe words: <hi>Viſiting the inquitie of the fathers vpon the children, &amp; vpon the childrens children, to the third and fourth generation.</hi> But mark, I pray you, that I do not leſſen or diminiſh Gods iuſtice, to inlarge his mercie; for that were moſt impious ſacrilege, ſeeing both are infinitely perfect aboue all vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall compariſon: but I ſpeake, as Moſes telleth vs that the Lord himſelf ſpake, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring the diſpleaſure or anger of his iuſtice, with the fauor of his mercy, in regard of his couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made in reſpect of Chriſt, by whoſe ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wrath of iuſtice is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted, yea, in reſpect of the elect,

For otherwiſe perfect; that is, infinite, both mercy and iuſtice, meete together in the ſaluation of the elect; God accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it iuſt to ſaue the vniuſt for Chriſts ſake, who is the Lord our righteouſneſſe. But let vs come to ſome other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies wherein God hath in ſingular maner renoumed his mercie. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the holy Pſalmiſt) <hi>is gratious and mercifull, ſlowe to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all and his mercies are ouer all his works.</hi> Pſal. 145.8.9. And Pſalm. 136. he repeateth this foote of the ſong, as often as there be verſes in the Pſalme; that is, 26 times one after the other: <hi>For his mercie endureth for euer.</hi> And he maketh this as the chiefe reaſon of all his workes; yea euen of his moſt fearefull and heauy iudgements vpon the wicked: in the which, he propoundeth to himſelfe, not ſo much the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and deſtruction of the wicked in his iuſtice, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of his Church and people, to the glory of his grace and mercie; as is eaſie to be ſeene in the reading of that Pſalme. According alſo to that Iſaiah 43.4. <hi>Becauſe thou wert pretious in my ſight, &amp; wert honorable, &amp; I loued thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>therefore will I giue man for thee, and people for thy ſake.</hi> This ſingular care of the Lord ouer his people, is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where repeated in the holy Scriptures, Read Pſalme. 9.9. and Pſal. 10.17. and 18.27. and 34.6. and 40.17. and 113.5. and 146.7.8.9. <hi>God will be a refuge to his poore people, he will heare them, he will ſaue them, he will deſtroy their enemies, &amp;c.</hi> And for what other cauſes alſo, doth God at any time aduance any of his ſeruants from poore eſtate to high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; out of aduerſity to proſperity; but that they might glorifie his name, in being a refuge and ſuccour to the reſt of their poore and diſtreſſed brethren; according as Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai ſendeth his admonitorie meſſage to Queene Eſter, chap. 4.14. ſaying: <hi>Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdome for ſuch a time'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who therfore ſeeth not, that the mercifull relieuing of the needie and poore, (ſpeciallie ſuch as approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12614:10"/> to be of the houſhold of faith, faithfull ſeruantes in the familie and Church of God is a vertue of ſingular excellencie: ſeeing ſuch as do thus, do herein ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſpeciall manner, as deare children, to be the moſt kindlie and ingenuous imitators and followers of God their heauenlie father, in that which he accounteth his moſt ſingular glorie as we haue ſeen before. In which reſpect alſo, ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt to his diſciples: <hi>Be ye mercifull, as your Father is mercifull.</hi> But not onelie muſt the children of God be like their heauenly father in doing good to their fellow brethren, but euen to their enemies alſo, as the ſame our Sauiour teacheth. For euen God is not onelie kind and beneficiall to the good and iuſt, but alſo to the vnkind and euill, cauſing the comfortable light and warmth of his Sunne to ariſe vpon them, and his raine to make their fieldes and cattell fruitfull: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.44.45. and Luke 6.35.36. Finallie, according to the holie Prouerbe, ch. 19.22. <hi>That which is to be deſired of a man is his goodneſſe.</hi> For herein ſpeciallie is all that comprehended for the which he is to be praiſed: as 2. Chron. 3 2. verſe 32. the whole praiſe of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is noted by his goodnes. And ſo alſo of king Ioſiah, ch. 35.26.</p>
               <p>The heathen alſo, whether by the light of nature, or by the remnant of tradition of doctrine, from the firſt fathers of whom they came, after the diſperſion of the nations, they held this for a principle, and ſo haue ſet it downe in their writings; that in nothing man is more like vnto God, then in beneficiall &amp; kind dealing. And when <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> (as they write) was asked, what man might haue, wherein he ſhould reſemble God, he anſwered: <hi>If he ſhould deale beneficiallie, and ſpeake trulie.</hi> And hence it was no doubt, that euen among the ſame heathen people of the world; the honourable title of <hi>beneficence</hi> and bountifulneſſe was, as it were, by a law of nations, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally attributed and aſcribed to Princes and Rulers; whom it ſhould beſeeme beſt, as in name, ſo in the vertue it ſelfe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12614:11"/> to expreſſe the diuine nature of God moſt. This couſtome of the heathen is pointed at by our Sauiour Chriſt, Luke. ch. 22.25. where he ſaith thus, <hi>They that beare rule ouer the Gentils are called</hi> EVERGETAI, that is, gratious, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall and bounteous.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, here, before wee goe any one ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is to good purpoſe, that we doe conſider, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the bounteous and beneficiall Giuing of the Lord, and all humane beneficence, there is neceſſarilly a great and vnmeaſurable difference to be put. Firſt, becauſe God is the onely ſpring and fountaine of all beneficence; ſo that from him alone are deriued all good giftes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer either man or Angell are partakers of, or howſoeuer they are made inſtrumentes of anie good benifite and bleſſing either of them to other. For as the Apoſtle Paul ſaith from the Prophete <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and both of them in the name of the Lord, <hi>Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord? or who was his counſeller? Or who hath giuen to him firſt, and he ſhall be recompenſed. For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glorie for euer. Amen. Rom.</hi> 11.34.35.36. and Iſaiah chap. 40.13.14. And yet more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly touching man; whether Prince or noble Peere, rich or mighty, learned or in authority, Prophet or Apoſtle, whoſoeuer he be, he cannot poſſibly haue any thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this world, or belonging to the kingdome of God, to giue, vnleſſe he haue firſt receiued it of that perfect and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plete fulneſſe which is only in the Lord. So that worthily may the Apoſtle aske of one as wel as of the other, &amp; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch as haue the moſt excellent gifts: <hi>Who ſeparateth thee? And what haſt thou which thou haſt not receiued? and if thou haſt receiued it, why doeſt thou boaſt as if thou hadſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it?</hi> 1. Cor. 4.7. And Iob. 1.21. <hi>The Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh away bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God giueth ſuch gifts, and in ſuch maner, as no creature is able to giue them. <hi>Thine ô Lord</hi> (ſaith king Dauid) <hi>is greatneſſe, and power, and glorie, and victory, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12614:11"/> praiſe: for all that is in heauen &amp; earth is thine, thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ô Lord, and thou excelleſt as head ouer all, &amp; in thine hand is power and ſtrength, and in thy hand it is to make great, and to giue ſtrength vnto all. Now therefore, ô our God, we thanke thee, and praiſe thy glorious name. But who am I, and what is my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that we ſhould be able to offer willingly after this ſort? For all things come of thee, &amp; of thine owne hand we haue giuen thee.</hi> 1. Chro. 29.11. &amp;c. And thus no one man, but only God hath giuen the whole earth, &amp; diſtributed it among all the ſons of men. Pſ. 115.16. Thus he &amp; no other hath giuen his only ſon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to and for the redemption &amp; ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his Church. Iſai. 9.6. &amp; ch. 49.6. Ioh. 3.16. &amp; ch. 4.10. &amp; Rom. 5.15. &amp;c. where the excellency of this one gift is amplified aboue all other by the holy Apoſtle: and ch. 8.31, 32. <hi>What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs? who ſpared not his owne ſon, but gaue him for vs to death, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo?</hi> According to this diuine munificence, God hath giuen the Church to Chriſt, Pſal. 2.8. &amp; Ioh. 17.6, 7, 8, &amp;c. to the end, that though it had iuſtly deſerued to be vtterly ſtripped, and left waſt &amp; naked, it might neuertheles by him be beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; adorned with al excellent &amp; princely gifts. Mat. 28.18 19, 20. Eph. 4.11, &amp;c. Ier. 3.15. Iſa. 50.4. euen with ſuch gifts as no money could purchaſe; but onely the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, which is more precious then all gold &amp; ſiluer, Act. 8.20. 1. Pet. 1.18.19. Among theſe moſt precious gifts, is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly knowledge &amp; vnderſtanding Pſ. 119.34. Mat. 11.25, 26, 27. &amp; ch. 13.11. &amp; ch. 16.17. Likewiſe faith &amp; repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; forgiueneſſe of ſins, are in the number of theſe inualua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gifts of God, Act. 5.31, 32. and ch. 11.17, 18. 2. Tim. 2.25, 26. Ier. 24.7. &amp; ch. 32.39.40. In this catalogue of the gifts of God, is that peace of conſcience which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, Philip. 4.7. that is to ſay, ſuch a gift, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy wherof cannot throughly be diſcerned of vs. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of this magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bounty of God, eternal life &amp; ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the gifts of God, to poore miſerable &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable ſinners.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12614:12"/> All theſe,<note place="margin">Gods bounty aboue mans.</note> and if there be any ſuch like; they are ſuch gifts of God, as infinitely exceede all mans donation and gift. And no maruell, though the gifts of God be thus ineſtimable; becauſe his loue toward vs, from whence they proceede, is paſſing all knowledge. Epheſ. 3.19. So that to ſet out the greatneſſe of Gods gifts, we may iuſtly ſay vnto God, with his holy Prophet: <hi>What ſhall we render to the Lord for all his benefites toward vs.</hi> Pſal. 116.12. And with his holy Apoſtle <hi>What thanks can we recompence to God, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Theſ. 3.9. And to admoniſh our ſelues of our duties: <hi>O my ſoule praiſe thou the Lord, and all that is within me praiſe his holy name. My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefites. Who forgiueth all thine iniquitie, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 103.1. &amp;c. Read alſo Pſalme 107. And to comfort our ſoules againſt all ſpirituall feares, anguiſh, and diſquietment; <hi>Returne to thy reſt ô my ſoule: for the Lord hath bene beneficiall vnto thee. Becauſe thou haſt deliuered my ſoule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling: I ſhall walke before the Lord in the land of the liuing, Pſal. 116.1. &amp;c.</hi> Hetherto therefore, of the ſecond difference of Gods beneficence; how in meaſure, it infinitely exceedeth all the bountifulneſſe of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God only is conſtant and vnweariable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the bountie of his gifts vpon all ſuch as he chooſeth at the firſt, to beſtow his bountie vpon: for <hi>Whom he once loueth, he loueth to the end.</hi> Iohn. 13.1. <hi>The vnchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God is expreſſed by his fatherly loue.</hi> Mal. chap. 1.2. and Rom. 9.13. <hi>As it is written, I haue loued Iaakob.</hi> And Rom. 11.29. <hi>The gifts &amp; calling of God are without repentance</hi> and Hoſh. 13.14. <hi>Repentance is hid from mine eyes.</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, 1. Theſ. 5.24. <hi>Faithfull is he which hath called you, and he will do it.</hi> and Iſai 40.28. <hi>Knoweſt thou not? or haſt thou not heard, that the euerlaſting Lord the God hath created the ends of the earth? He neither fainteth nor is weary: there is no ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his vnderſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> and verſ. 31. <hi>They that wait vpon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the cauſe, why king Dauid, in the place before alleadged:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12614:12"/> 1. Chron. 29. acknowledging the preſent great grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon himſelfe, and the people, in offering willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the houſe and worſhip of God, to be his ſpeciall gift: he prayeth God, to keepe the ſame grace for euer, in the purpoſe and thoughts of the hearts of his people, and that he would ſtil prepare their harts vnto himſelf. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he would giue to his ſonne Salomon a perfect heart, to keepe his commandement, &amp;c. For right well did the holy king know, that man left to himſelf, is lighter then vanity; and moſt fickle in the purpoſe and care of the beſt things; and namely, in beneficence and liberality toward the Church and people of God. Wherefore alſo, well ſaith a godly learned man: that it is proper to God to hold on in a continuall care to ſaue and preſerue, and not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to ceaſe from the beſtowing of his benefites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are vnworthy of them.</p>
               <p>Finally, he is infinitely more kind and bounteous to his enemies then any man, or all men can be to theirs, though all their kindneſſe were layd together. Matth. 5.45. Luk. 6.35.36. Rom. 2.4. And that either moſt gratiouſly to win their ſoules vnto him, for their owne moſt happy ſaluation: or els to leaue them altogether moſt iuſtly without excuſe. But thus the greatneſſe of Gods diuine bountie, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his giftes, furpaſſing all gifts that anie man or Angell, yea that all men or Angels can poſſibly giue: they haue held vs ſomewhat longer then was at the firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though not with loſt time or labour, as we truſt. Let vs now return to inſtruct our ſelues further touching that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence and giuing which ought to be in continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe among men; after the example and preſident which we haue in the Lord, ſo far as we (preuented by his good grace) may in our meaſure attaine vnto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giuing</hi> therefore (wherein men in their poore meaſure may by the grace of God reſemble that diuine bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is in God, like as many little gutters or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12614:13"/> of the ſtreame may declare how plentifull the head of the riuer or liuely ſpring is) <hi>it is</hi> (to ſpeake ſomething more generally) <hi>a free imparting and communicating of that which is (at the leaſt in a mans owne perſwaſion) rightly his owne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Giuing what, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</note> 
                  <hi>to the vſe or commodity and poſſeſſion of another.</hi> Or thus: <hi>It is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienating of a mans own right, to make another the owner of that, wherein he had all the property before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to this more generall definition, a man might take occaſion to ſpeake more generallie of giuing; by a diſtinction of Giftes, according to the diuerſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtate of the giuers; and according to their ſeueral minds &amp; purpoſes in giuing, and ſo forth. For there are gifts of the Subiect to the Prince, as the Moabites and Aramites brought giftes to king Dauid, when he had ſubdued them: 1. Chron. 18.2.6. of the ſeruant to the Maſter, of the tenant to the landlord, and of the child to the father, as gratulatory and dutiful preſents for honours ſake, as Ioſeph ſent gifts to Iaakob his father out of Egypt into Canaan. Gen. 45.23.</p>
               <p>And againe, there are gifts of the Prince to the Subiect for reward, or of mere clemencie and fauour, according to the royall bountie of a Prince; as in the 6. ch. of the booke of Eſter, where the great king Ahaſhueroſh asketh <hi>Haman: What ſhall be done to the man whom the king will honour?</hi> And Dan. 2.48. king Nebuchadnezzar made <hi>Daniel</hi> a great man, and gaue him manie and great giftes.</p>
               <p>There are giftes of the poorer and weaker, to thoſe that be more rich and mighty, to procure fauor, or at the leaſt, to mitigate the rage &amp; furie of anger; to which end, Iaakob preſented his gifts to Eſau, and in moſt ſubmiſſe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner deſired him to accept of his preſent. And as wiſe Abigail by her preſents, together with her gratious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, appeaſeth the wrath of Dauid, greatlie kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her husband Nabal. Of the which kind of giftes, it is ſaid in the holie Prouerbes: <hi>A gift in ſecret pacifieth anger, and a gift in the boſome great wrath.</hi> Prouerb. 21.14.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide; there are gifts of the rich and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12614:13"/> to the poorer and inferiour ſort,<note place="margin">Diuerſe kinds of gifts</note> becauſe they mind to make them indebted to them, that they may vſe them for their greater benefite and gaine, as Pharaoh preferred Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, and Nebuchadnezzar Daniel, and thoſe other three men of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Some giue gifts, to helpe out good and iuſt cauſes and ſutes, as Iaakob ſent preſents to the chiefe Gouernour of Egypt; little thinking that it had bene Ioſeph his ſonne: Gen. 43.11. <hi>Take</hi> (ſaith he to his ſonnes) <hi>of the beſt fruites of the land in your veſſels, and bring the man a preſent, &amp;c.</hi> And contrariwiſe, ſome giue gifts to corrupt true iudgement, &amp; to contriue and compaſſe a miſchiefe: of whom it is ſayd, <hi>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome to wreſt the wayes of iudgement.</hi> Pro. 17.23. and thus Ziba preſented king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid with a gift, minding and compaſſing treacherie againſt his maiſter, 2. Sam. 16. For a gift if it be once accepted it is of great force euery way, as Prou. 17.8. <hi>It proſpereth, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoeuer it turneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, there are gifts of one friend and neigbour to an other; and that of all degrees, when they are kindly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the one to the other, for mutuall loue and friendſhips ſake; the one ſtriuing after a ſort to ouercome the other with kindneſſe and benefites: according to the common ſaying which goeth concerning ſuch: <hi>There is no loue loſt betwixt them.</hi> After this maner the Queene of Sheba gaue king Salomon great gifts: and he againe requited her with like royoll gifts, 1. King. ch. 10. verſes 10.13. The which kind of ſtrife hath bene alwayes honourable, euen among the nations of the heathen; and the more honorable, becauſe (as they rightly eſteemed) if a man ſtriue vnto thankfulnes, there is no reproch or diſhonour, though he be vnwillingly ouercome. They write of Taxiles, a pettie king of India, that he offered Alexander, comming out to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, this notable challenge: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou be our inferiour, receiue a benefite of vs; but if thou be our better, then do vs a good turne.</hi> Alexander accepting the challenge: <hi>We
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12614:14"/> will ſtriue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether of vs ſhall be the more beneficiall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Giuing what, more ſpeciall.</note> Alexander then imbracing Taxiles verie cuteouſly, did not only abſtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus as was ſaid, there are diuerſe kindes of gifts, and great varietie in the diuerſe maner of the beſtowing and placing of them.</p>
               <p>But it is not the intent of the preſent Treatiſe, to followe this argument in ſo large a diſcourſe; but only to ſpeake of religious and me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now that it is ſo, that a Gift muſt be free, and proceede of a liberall and franke mind, it is euident and plaine from that which our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth in the ſixth chapter of the Euangeliſt Luke, verſes 33, 34, 35. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye doe good to them which do good to you, what thanke ſhall ye haue?

               <p>If then Chriſtians muſt be beneficiall to their enemies, though nothing can be looked for in way of recompence from their hands; much rather muſt we be helpfull to thoſe that be Chriſtianly minded toward vs, though they ſhall neuer be able to requite vs. If we muſt ouercome euil with goodneſſe (which as it is the moſt honourable, ſo is it the moſt difficult victorie that may be) much rather muſt we ouercome our ſelues, to do good to thoſe, who wold, if they were able, giue vs incouragement by their kindneſſe, to ſtriue this way with them. It is contrary to the nature of a gift for the Giuer to haue any deſire of a recompence for it. This were rather to put to vſurie, or to ſell, or at the leaſt to make an exchange of one thing for another, &amp; not to giue a gift. He that giueth a gift in truth, muſt do it ſimply, euen for it ſelfe, as it were, becauſe in his owne heart he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it meete and worthy that it ſhould be done, becauſe God hath ſo commanded, and becauſe he hath promiſed ſo much the rather to recompence it, by how much all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane quittance is more firmly neglected. To this purpoſe (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <hi>When thou makeſt a feaſt, bid thou the poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blinde, that cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thee againe, and thou ſhalt be recompenced at the day of the reſurrection.</hi> Luke ch. 14.12, 13.14.</p>
               <p>That alſo which our Sauiour Chriſt commaundeth his diſciples, concerning the preaching of the Gopell and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of miracles, which were precious gifts of God, ſaying: <hi>Freely ye haue receiued, freely giue,</hi> Matth. 10.8. the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath place by a certaine analogie and proportion in the diſtribution of the outward bleſſings &amp; Gifts of God, from the hands of all thoſe to whom, as to his ſtewards, he hath of his free fauour committed the diſtribution of them. For ſeeing God giueth the one as well as the other of his free bountie, theſe as well as they, are to be diſtributed freely, of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12614:15"/> beneuolence, and not as of ſparing, or grudgingly, as Paul inſtructeth the Corinthians, 2. epiſt. 9.5. And againe in the 14. verſe of his Epiſtle to Philemon: <hi>Without thy mind</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would I do nothing, that thy benefite ſhould not be as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, but willingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Creeple, which lay at the gate of the Temple of Ieruſalem to aske almes, deſired an almes of Peter and Iohn, as we read, Act. 3.2. &amp;c. Peter ſaith vnto him: <hi>Siluer and gold I haue none, but that which I haue, that I giue thee: In the name of Ieſus Chriſt of Nazareth ariſe and walke.</hi> Peter no doubt was willing to haue giuen gold or ſiluer to the Cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple freely, if he had had it, as may appeare in that he gaue willingly and freely that which was better than gold.</p>
               <p>This grace of freeneſſe or frankneſſe is neceſſarie, to the end it may be done with chearefulneſſe and gladneſſe of heart; which is a grace of neare affinitie with the former, and is greatly eſteemed of the Lord: according as it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord loueth a chearfull giuer,</hi> 2. Cor. 9.7. Yea, ſo doth he loue it, that he preferreth a ſmaller gift, which commeth willingly and chearefully, before a gift of greater value, when it is drawne forth conſtrainedly. Wherefore (as the Apoſtle ſaith) according <hi>as euery man wiſheth in his heart, not grudgingly, or of neceſſitie, for God loueth a chearfull giuer:</hi> in the place euen now alleaged. And before that, in the 12. verſe of the eigth chapter. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> Hence alſo it is that, in the beginning of the ſame chapter, Saint Paul verie highly commendeth the Chriſtians of the Macedonian Churches, becauſe in great triall of affliction their ioy abounded, and their moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pouertie abounded to their rich liberalitie. <hi>For to their power</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I beare record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing: And prayed vs with great inſtance that we would receiue the grace and fellowſhip of the miniſtring which is toward the Saints.</hi> A notable example of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent grace, the which being ſo ſingularly commended by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12614:16"/> the holy Ghoſt;<note place="margin">Examples of chearfull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> may iuſtly both giue incouragement to ſuch as are at any time moſt free and franke (ſeeing as the Apoſtle giueth to vnderſtand, they haue herein a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable fellowſhip in a verie gratious worke, moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all hands to be holpen forward) and alſo it may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhame the moſt beggerly and ſeruile liberalitie of the common ſort of worldly profeſſours, whoſe hearts are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, as it were, chayned and locked vp in their cheſtes and purſes. For when due conſideration of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do oftentimes much commend and aduaunce a thing aboue it ſelfe, being ſimply conſidered; and namely in this action of liberall giuing, when a thing is giuen with a large heart, and not niggardly; willingly, yea deſirouſly of themſelues, and not by any vehement intreatie of others; of that little which a man hath, and not of ſuperfluitie; when a man eſteemeth his gift a benefite, yea an honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in that he is admitted to haue communion with the Saints of God, to the reliefe of his Saints; and finally, when a man ſeeketh the occaſion of giuing and offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, rather then ſtayeth till he be prompted by others, &amp; neglecteth not the occaſion being manifeſtly offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: by all theſe circumſtances the liberalitie of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians is commended vnto vs for a rare example to be followed herein.</p>
               <p>But the Macedonians are not altogether alone. Let vs therefore helpe forward our owne ſlackneſſe by ſome other examples. Among the which Zache in the 19. chapter of the Euangeliſt Luke (though he were leaſt in ſtature of body among a great multitude) yet he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample as tall as a Cedar in Lebanon, yea and alſo ſpeedily ſhot vp in more excellent manner then the gourd of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, to the magnifying of the mightie power of God, in the grace of his bleſſed Goſpell. For ſo ſoone as he began to taſt of the ſweetneſſe of that ſaluation which is brought to light by our Sauiour Chriſt, hee ſtandeth forth, and his heart is inlarged to profeſſe, euen before the Lord, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12614:16"/> knew his heart: <hi>Behold Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore, &amp;c.</hi> And verily, if we aske the cauſe why the common ſort of our rich pofeſſours (a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber excepted in compariſon of the reſt) are now a dayes ſo skant in giuing, as they are; and in their skantneſſe ſo vnchearefull: it is for that their heartes continue ſo furfetted and oppreſſed with groſſe cares and couetous deſires after this worldly pelfe, that they haue ſmall taſt, and willingly are ignorant (notwithſtanding they haue much teaching) what thoſe fruites bee, which the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God toward themſelues, ought to drawe from them, in reſpect of their brethren: which leſſon Zache, being a willing and teachable ſcholler, by and by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>And let vs well marke that our Sauiour Chriſt, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer of Zache, which was but of halfe his goods to the poore, refuſeth to giue any incouragement to that other rich man in the 18. chap. of the ſame Goſpell, vnleſſe he would ſell all that he had, and giue the ſame wholly to the poore. Why was that? Zache being inlightened by faith, and touched with godly ſorrow for his ſinnes, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the halfe of his goods to the poore, with a hearty and chearfull affection, to declare his thankfulneſſe to the Lord for his great mercy toward him in the forgiuenes of his ſinnes, &amp;c. But the other rich man goeth away heauie and ſorrowfull, euen to thinke of parting from his earthly poſſeſſions and goods; preferring them before the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all riches &amp; inheritance of the kingdome of heauen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he remaining vnbeleeuing, and without repentance, goeth from Chriſt, without any comfort at all, for that time. And the hardneſſe of his heart, in that he was cloſed and ſhut vp againſt the poore, was alſo euen as a barre to hold out the comfort of Gods mercies, that it could make no entrance, nor finde anie friendlie entertainment with him.</p>
               <p>But that we may ſee, as in a chryſtall glaſſe, of what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12614:17"/> reckening a chearfull and heartie giuer is in the ſight of God: let vs conſider the example of the poore widowe, as it followeth in the 21. chapter of Luke, in compariſon of manie rich men. For though in reſpect of the ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of her offering, ſhe gaue as good as nothing to ſpeake of, yet her gift is preferred before the greater quantitie of all the rich mens offering put together at the ſame time: <hi>Of a truth</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, ſeeing her willing and ready mind) <hi>this widdow hath caſt in more then they all. For they haue of their ſuperfluitie, caſt into the offerings of God, but ſhe of her penurie hath caſt in all the liuing ſhe had.</hi> Our Sauior giueth to vnderſtand, that ſhe had no more then ſhe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till ſhe ſhould earne it with her fingers ends, as we vſe to ſpeake. Her example therfore is notable, in that ſhe wold rather want her ſelfe, then to be altogether wanting in the holy contribution to the treaſurie of the Lords Temple.</p>
               <p>The like willingneſſe and cheerfulneſſe of mind, did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe more plentifully in outward fruits, in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent woman Dorcas, according to her more rich and able eſtate, who vſed to clothe the poore with coates and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſhe made at her owne coſtes and charges, to the relieuing of many Chriſtians, as we reade Act. 9.36. &amp;c. Lydia alſo was ſo earneſt, that ſhe conſtrained Paul and his company to come to her houſe and to abide there. Act. 16.15.</p>
               <p>The like chearfulneſſe ought to be in the heart of euerie godly woman, according to that notable deſcription of a vertuous wife, in the laſt chapter of the Prouerbes; where it is written, that <hi>She ſtretcheth out her hands to the poore,</hi> yea <hi>both of her hands to the needy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto let vs adde the example of that noble Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah, for ſingular mercifulneſſe, in venturing his owne life, in hiding and foſtering a hundreth of the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to preſerue them from the rage of Iezabel. 1. King. 18.3.4. Surely Obadiah would neuer haue put his life in ſo great hazard, if he had not had a franke and free heart
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12614:17"/> thereunto. Abraham ran to giue his gueſts intertainment, Gen. 18.2.</p>
               <p>But not to ſtay in particulars any longer, let vs come to the generall commendation of the people of God, in their holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribution toward the Tabernacle of the Lord, Exo. 35.20. &amp;c. <hi>Euerie one</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>whoſe heart incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, and euery one whoſe ſpirit made him willing, came and brought an offering to the Lord for the worke of the Taberna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>le of the Congregation, and for all the vſes thereof, and for the holy garments: Both men and women, as many as were free hearted, &amp;c. they brought a free offering to the Lord, gold, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lke precious ſtones &amp;c.</hi> The women brought their looking glaſſes made of ſome ſhining mettal chap. 38.8. Yea, more then enough was offered by the congregation. chap. 36.5.6. Reade alſo 2. Chron. 29.31.36. and chap. 35.8. where the willingnes of the Princes and whole congregation, is commended both in king Hezekiah, and alſo in king Ioſiah his reigne.</p>
               <p>And let this (I pray you) be well obſerued, that the Lord doth not for his part, willingly accept of any offering or dutie, which is not performed with a willing and cheareful heart, as appeareth in the fifth verſe of the 36. chap. of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, where he admitteth only the willing heart to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>This is the thing</hi> (ſaith Moſes) <hi>which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, ſaying: Take from among you an offring vnto the Lord. Whoſoeuer is of a willing heart, let him bring</hi> ſuch or ſuch an offering, as is there expreſſed. It is like to the proclamation which the Lord maketh, Deut. 20.8. concerning the going forth of his people to fight his battailes. <hi>Whoſoeuer is afraid or faint-hearted</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>let him go and returne to his houſe, leaſt his brethrens heart faint like his heart.</hi> The Lord we ſee, refuſeth the faint-hearted ſouldier, as no ſouldier for him. And euen ſo he refuſeth the vnchearfull Giuer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ributor, or offerer, either toward his worſhip, or toward the reliefe of the poore among his people, as no meete offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers or contributors to him; ſeeing they be ſuch, as haue not yet taken any courage to fight againſt that prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12614:18"/> couetouſneſſe, and diſtruſt in Gods prouidence, with many other ſinnes, which of neceſſitie muſt be ouercome by a ſpirituall encounter againſt them, before the Lord can take pleaſure either in the giuer and offerer, or in the gift and offering which is tendered before him: whereof we haue for euident examples, Cain in the old world, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias with Sapphira his wife in the latter dayes of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, not without great cauſe doth king Dauid (as was vpon occaſion touched before) giue moſt heartie and glorious praiſe vnto God, for giuing himſelfe and his people, hearts to offer willingly for the building of the Lords Temple. 1. Chron. 29.14, &amp;c. And let vs obſerue it well, that it is indeed a ſpeciall grace, from the bounteous hand and gratious Spirit of God; and the ſame alſo a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular token of his loue, when any can with willing hearts, as wiſe diſpoſers of the manifold grace of God, chearfully diſtribute the good gifts of God, which he hath made them ſtewards of. For doubtleſſe, there is naturally in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, ſo great ſelfe-loue and couetous deſire to increaſe ſtill in worldly riches &amp; wealth, and ſo little zeale of Gods word, or loue to his children, that our harts may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the bowe-net, which eaſily taketh in the fiſh, but hardly letteth any go out againe; and our hands are as one wold ſay, ſo glewiſh or bird-limed, that they hold faſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer commeth into them; ſo all is fiſh which commeth to not. Liberalitie therefore and frankneſſe of heart is a gift or grace of God.</p>
               <p>A very neare, yea an inſeparable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion to this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, franke and free-heartedneſſe, whereof we haue hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſpoken; is a holy ioy and delight as well in giuing to the reliefe of men, as in offering to the honor and glory of God. So we read concerning the notable example of the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians alleaged before, that their ioy abounded in their willing and chearful contribution. And ſo likewiſe we ſawe in the example of king Dauid &amp; his people. <hi>The people</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12614:18"/> the text) <hi>reioyced when they offered willingly to the Lord with a perfect heart. And Dauid the king reioyced alſo with great ioy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioy is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with cheerfulneſſe in giuing.</note> Read alſo Deut. 26.10.11.14. The thank-offering muſt not be celebrated in the morning, or vnchearfully, but with great ioy &amp; gladnes of heart. As for grudging and vnbetee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it hath no place nor fellowſhip in this buſineſſe: let it therfore be ſent packing with Iudas, who by reaſon of this euill affection in himſelfe, and becauſe of his theeuiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, could take no ioy, no not in another bodies coſt; to wit, when Mary the ſiſter of Lazarus, beſtowed her coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ointment, as a token of that honour and loue which ſhee bare to our Sauior Chriſt, Ioh. 12.3. &amp;c. It ought long ſince to haue bin rotted &amp; mouldred away, with the carkeiſe of that ancient and great churle, drunken Nabal, 1. Sam. 25.10.13. with whom alſo let vs leaue the grunting of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derenes, Mat. 8.34. and the inhoſpitall Samaritans, Luk. 9.52.53. And let vs on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, as beſeemeth al good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, hearken to the preceptory exhortation of the holy Apoſtles Paul &amp; Peter. <hi>Be ye harborous one to another without grudging</hi> 1. Pet. 4.9. &amp; Philip. 2.14. <hi>Do all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring and reaſonings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to the end theſe euil affections of Iudas, Nabal, &amp; the reſt, may be relinquiſhed &amp; caſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the ſeruants of God; &amp; that ſuch as giue or offer to holy vſes, may do that which they do, with a franke and liberall mind, and ſo haue much ioy and comfort in it; it is further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more neceſſarie that they haue theſe graces following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a delightful and precious eſtimation of thoſe things whereunto they do giue and contribute, whether it be to the maintenance of Gods worſhip, or for the reliefe of his poore Saints. Secondly, faith. Thirdly, humility. Of theſe therefore, let vs conſider, ſo farre as may concerne the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue in hand.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe graces; let it not ſeeme te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, to looke yet once againe vpon king Dauid, ſeeing God hath euery way made him a moſt beautifull example
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12614:19"/> and mirrour herein.<note place="margin">The giuer muſt haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and precious eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that to which he giueth.</note>

An euident proofe whereof, may be taken from that his moſt ioyous dauncing before the Lord with all his might, when God vouchſafed to permit him to fetch home the holy Arke to the citie where he dwelt, 2. Sam. 6. And further alſo, from that ioy, which he tooke at the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſe of religion; as is euident, Pſal. 122. where he profeſſeth, that he did in ſingular maner reioyce, when the people ſayd vnto him: <hi>We will go into the houſe of the Lord.

Theſe, though they haue oftentimes wanne &amp; thinne faces, with ſpare and weake bodies, for want of more full and daintie diet, and though they goe poorelie clothed; yet, beſides that the temples of their bodies are redeemed by the precious bloud of Chriſt, their ſoules, which are the principall part, and as the Mannor houſe of that rich purchaſe, they are richly adorned with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt. And therefore in no wiſe may they, by any who belong to the Lord, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; but rather be highly eſteemed and honoured: or elſe all beneficence toward them, wil eaſily ceaſe, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weare away. To this purpoſe, we are to remember not only what the holy Prouerbe ſaith, that <hi>he who is mercifull to the poore, and freely giueth vnto him, maketh the Lord his debter, who will ſurely repay him:</hi> but alſo that the Lord eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the poore ſo precious vnto him, namely, thoſe that do truly beleeue in him: that he accounteth it done to himſelf whatſoeuer is done vnto them. Matth. 29. as is plaine in that deſcription of his laſt iudgement. Thus farre of the firſt grace neceſſarie to a free and liberall mind.</p>
               <p>The ſecond grace is faith; that is to ſay, not onely a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that they which practiſe this dutie, do pleaſe God in ſo doing; but alſo, that he will bleſſe and gratiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for all ſuch, as ſhall continue in the ſame courſe: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coring to the teſtimony of the holy Aopoſtle, Heb, 13.16. where he giueth this charge: <hi>To do good, and to diſtribute for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not: for with ſuch ſacrifices God is pleaſed,</hi> and Philip. 4.18.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12614:20"/> Saint Paule affirmeth,<note place="margin">A gift muſt be giuen in humility, chiefly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God.</note> that they are as an odour that ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſweete, and a ſacrifice acceptable and pleaſant to God: according alſo to that excellent comfort which followeth immediately in the ſame place, in that he writeth thus: <hi>And my God will fulfil all your neceſſities through his riches, with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Reade alſo Hoſh. chap. 6. verſ. 6. where the Lord preferreth mercie before ſacrifice and therefore it cannot be but he greatly accounteth of this dutie. But for the further ſtrengthening of faith in this point, reade more in the third chapter of this Treatiſe, concerning the reward of right Chriſtian Giuing.</p>
               <p>The third grace neceſſarie to franke and liberall Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, is, that ſuch as doe giue to others, yea, or toward the worſhip of God, be humbled in the ſight and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their vnworthineſſe, of the leaſt of thoſe good bleſſings, which they enioy from the hand of God; ſo that they may ſay in truth of heart, as Iaakob did: <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and all the truth vvhich thou haſt ſhewed vnto thy ſeruant,</hi> Geneſ. chap. 32. verſ. 10. Yea, ſo neceſſarie is this grace, to the practiſe of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and liberalitie, that the Apoſtle Paule, minding to exhort to the practiſe of it, doth firſt of all giue warning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt pride, which he knew would otherwiſe hinder the ſame. Yea he commandeth in the name of the Lord, that there be a continuall charge giuen againſt it, both by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie, and alſo by all other miniſters of the Goſpell to the end of the world. <hi>Charge them</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that are rich in this vvorld, that they be not high minded, and that they truſt not in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God (who giueth vs aboundantly all thinges to enioy) That they do good, and be rich in good vvorks, and ready to diſtribute and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.

In the which wordes, note alſo, that together with this morall precept of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie toward men, hee leaueth no place for opinion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12614:20"/> of merit with God, which is the height of pride;<note place="margin">A Gift muſt be giuen in righteouſnes.</note> and in truth, the moſt ſtrong poiſon and bane of all true benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; yea, that which vtterly peruerteth and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whatſoeuer good thing a man may ſeeme to doe. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto of the firſt branch of our Definition or deſcription of Giuing, <hi>that it is a free, or franke, and liberall imparting or communicating to other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth now, that it is <hi>a communicating of ſome meete and conuenient portion of that wherewith God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath bleſſed euery one aboue the reſt of his people:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, theſe three things do offer themſelues to be conſidered of vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Chriſtian Giuing or liberall beneficence, is to bee prractiſed in righteouſneſſe; and of that which is a mans owne, iuſtly obtained and gotten.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Beneficence and the actions thereof are to bee ordered wiſely, and according to good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is a dutie belonging to euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whomſoeuer God hath in any meaſure made able to ſpare any thing, to relieue his brother or neighbour, who is more poore and needie then himſelfe. Of all and euerie one of theſe, let vs conſider in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe three points; namely, that Chriſtian beneficence is to be perfourmed of that which is our owne iuſtly gotten: howe can wee thinke that it ſhould be otherwiſe, ſeeing God requireth of all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, both high and lowe, rich and poore, that alwayes, in all things, they do exerciſe iuſtice and iudgement? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which we reade Pſalme 106.3. <hi>Bleſſed are they which keepe iudgement and do righteouſneſſe at all times.</hi> In which reſpect alſo, the ſeruantes of God are euerie where in the holy Scriptures, noted by this propertie in generall, that they loue righteouſneſſe. And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, concerning this dutie of liberality and beneficence,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12614:21"/> which we ſpeake of; the verie almes which the ſeruants of God are to giue, and which only God alloweth, it beareth euen the name of Righteouſneſſe: and that not onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a dutie, of right and iuſtice to be perfourmed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch as haue need; but that therewithall likewiſe we might be giuen to vnderſtand, that it is iuſt and right, that almes ſhould be giuen of that which is righly a mans owne, and not of that which is gotten by any vnrighteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. To this purpoſe tendeth that which we read, Deut. 24.13. where the Lord our God ſpeaking of right mercifull dealing to the poore, ſaith; that it ſhall be accounted for righteouſneſſe, to ſuch as duly practiſe the ſame. And Dan. 4.24. the holy Prophet exhorting the vniuſt and cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to take thence forward a iuſt and mercifull courſe; he counſelleth him to break off his ſinnes by this kind of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and mercie toward the poore. And Pſal. 112. verſ. 2. The Spirit of God ſpeaking of the right mercifull and true almes-man indeed; he alleadgeth by his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that his righteouſneſſe is a ioynt companion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a guide of his mercie. <hi>He is mercifull</hi> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) <hi>and full of compaſſion and righteouſneſſe.</hi> And againe: <hi>He hath diſtributed and giuen to the poore: his righteouſneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer.</hi> The which place of Scripture the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul citing to the ſame purpoſe, 2. Cor. 9.9. he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the liberalitie of the mercifull man, by the ſame word <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> though our Engliſh tranſlation vſeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word, ſaying in the ſame ſence, <hi>His beneuolence endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer.</hi> And verſe 10. <hi>God will increaſe the fruite of your beneuolence. Prouentus iuſtitiae.</hi> The Greeke text is in either verſe DICAIOSVNE, <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> as it is in the Hebrue TSIDQATH. Likewiſe in the beginning of the ſixth chap. of Matth. in ſteed of <hi>almes</hi> which is in the Greeke, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian word, after the maner of the Hebrue phraſe, as alſo of the Chalde, as Tremelius in his note vpon the ſame place, well obſerueth, is <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> in ſo much as almes is not the leaſt part thereof. For to ſpeake truly, no man can wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12614:21"/> beare the name, or doo indeede the part of a liberall man; vnleſſe he be firſt a righteous and iuſt dealing man. Liberalitie giuen of an other mans goodes, is no liberalitie from the hand of an vſurper, though he ſeemeth to be the giuer of them. It is rather his theft and fraude, or elſe his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and rapine; it is not his liberalitie. O how much better were it, for ſuch a one to make reſtitution, rather then to beare the face or rather the viſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d of a liberall and mercifull man! verilie, almes of that which is gotten by iniquitie, is abomination to the Lord. The crie of him, who hath beene oppreſſed, ſpoiled, or defrauded, will be louder in the eares of the Lord for vengeance; then the praier, or thankeſ-offering of the other, for bleſſing and reward. For what reaſon or equitie is there, that ſome ſmall portion, which vnrighteous men giue, of that vnmercifull yea cruell hauock and ſpoile wich they haue made, ſhould take away any guiltineſſe of their great and grieuous ſinne. Wherefore, let ſo manie as minde to make practiſe of true liberalitie, hearken in the feare of God, to the wiſe counſell of king Salomon, Prou. ch. 5.15. <hi>Drinke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the water of thy ciſterne, and of the riuers out of the middeſt of thine owne well. Let thy fountaines flowe forth, and the riuers of waters in the ſtreets:</hi> that is, ioyfully enioy and vſe that portion of outward bleſſings, which God hath in mercie, as a fruit of thy honeſt labour, or otherwiſe as it hath pleaſed him, to beſtow vpon thee; not onely for thy neceſſitie, but euen for thy ſober delight and comfort alſo: prouided, that of that which thou maiſt ſpare, as it were the ouerflowings of thy full ciſterne, others that ſtand in need, and are as the drie and thirſty ground, may be mercifully refreſhed and relicued by thee. And then it followeth in the ſame place for a further inſtruction: <hi>But let them be thine, euen thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not a ſtrangers with thee:</hi> that is, order the matter ſo, that through no euill or intemperate abuſe of thine, God be prouoked to alienate thy goods from thy ſelfe to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: of the which iudgement he had ſpoken before in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12614:22"/> tenth verſe of the ſame chapter.<note place="margin">A gift muſt be giuen with diſcretion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Lord proteſteth expreſly, that he hateth robberie, yea though it be ioyned with burnt offering: Iſai 61.8. As though the Lord ſhould ſay, Such kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without true repentance, ſhall find no expiation with me, how plentifull ſoeuer they are in their vniuſt ſacrifices. For as it is in the holy Prouerb. chap. 15. verſe 8. <hi>The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And Deut. chap. 23. verſe 18. <hi>It is abomination to the Lord thy God to bring the hyre of a vvhore, or the price of a dog into his houſe for anie vow.</hi> The ſacrifices which may be pleaſing to the Lord, muſt not onely be in their owne nature and kinde ſuch as they ought to be, without blemiſh, of the beſt of the flocke or heard: but alſo they muſt be euery way, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of righteouſneſſe, as touching the whole manner of the offering of them. And our owne they muſt be, by ſpeciall right and intereſt, and not another mans; or come to vs lightly and at aduenture wee cannot tell how. Right worthie is the ſaying of king Dauid to Ornan (yea though he would for his part haue giuen his threſhing flower vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for a place dedicatorie to the worſhip of God) <hi>Not ſo</hi> (ſaith he, ſeeing he was himſelfe to dedicate it vnto God) <hi>but I will buy it for ſufficient money: for I vvill not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings without coſt.</hi> 1. Chron. chap. 21. verſe 24. And right worthy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is that proteſtation of Zacheus in the Goſpell, who diſpoſing halfe his goods to the poore, as a fruit of his faith, repentance and loue vnto Chriſt, doth promiſe alſo reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that wrong dealing, wherewith any could iuſtly charge him.</p>
               <p>The foundation of Chriſtian beneficence and giuing, being thus laid, as it were, in righteouſnes: the ſecond point now followeth, wherein it is required, that beneficence firſt iuſtly gotten, ſhould no leſſe wiſely and diſcreetly be afterward ordered and diſpoſed. For (as we might perceiue euen now) king Salomon deuideth the wealth and riches
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12614:22"/> of a man, into that which is contained in the ciſtern, which is as it were the ſtocke, the which muſt not be ſuffered at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time, ouer negligently and waſtfully to run out, as if a man ſhould pull out the plugge at the bottome: and into the ouerflowings of the ciſterne, which are as the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the reuenues and increaſe; the which, though they be employed to the benefiting of ſuch as bee not of their owne proper family &amp; charge, yet will not impaire a mans eſtate.

               <p>The reaſon why the ſeruats of God, are in times of more then ordinarie want, to make an extraordinarie ſupply, is, for that euen, as in times of perſecution, the Lord taketh triall of the faith of thoſe that be truly his, toward himſelfe: for to ſhrinke away were notable and ſhamefull vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: ſo in times of ſpeciall ſcarcitie and want, God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth triall of our loue to our brethren, whether we ſet more by our money and outward goods, then by the ſpirituall comfort of their ſoules, and maintenance of their liues; which doubtleſſe were not only ſingular vnkindneſſe, but euen grieuous vnmercifulneſſe, yea crueltie to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in any of the children of God.</p>
               <p>Neither may this ſeeme ſtrange, that for the loue which we beare to the brethren, we ſhould disburſe part of our outward goods, for the comfort of their naturall liues, and to incourage them to walke chearfully in the wayes of the Lord: ſeeing (if need ſhould ſo require) we muſt not thinke our liues too deare, to poure them foorth for their preſeruation, and for the comfort and confirmation of their faith, as 1. Iohn. 3.16. <hi>We ought to lay downe our liues for the brethren.</hi> And ſo we reade that Priſcilla and Aquila indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered their owne liues, and were willing to haue died, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Paules life ſhould haue bene deſtroyed, Rom. 16.4. <hi>To whom therfore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not I only giue thanks, but alſo all the Churches of the Gentils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, both in the ordinarie and alſo in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie diſtribution of that almes and beneficence, which anie Chriſtian giueth, great caution is to be vſed, for the preuenting of all vnneceſſarie waſte, leſt that bee looſely and vnskilfully ſcattered and throwne about, which ought to be very wiſely as it were ſowne, and moſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandly diſpoſed. To this purpoſe is that which we reade in the fift verſe of the 112. Pſalme. <hi>A good man is mercifull and lendeth, and will meaſure his affaires by iudgement.</hi> That is, hee will order and moderate all things with ſo good diſcretion, and keepe himſelfe within ſo good a compaſſe, that in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12614:23"/> good, he will ſtill continue to doe good; yea and that with an increaſe, and not by decreaſing through the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God. For as king Salomon ſaith in his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes: <hi>Through wiſedome is an houſe builded, and by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is eſtabliſhed. And by knowledge ſhall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleaſant riches.</hi> chap. 24.3.4. And againe, chap. 21.20. <hi>In the houſe of the wiſe is a pleaſant trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and oyle: but a fooliſh man deuoureth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then we may ſee, that beneficence by wiſedome may be practiſed, not onely without vtter impoueriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; but alſo to the further inriching, &amp; to the moſt ſingular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit &amp; bleſſing of the wiſe and diſcreet practiſers of it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which followeth in the verie next Prouerb: <hi>He that followeth after righteouſneſſe and mercy, ſhall find life, righteouſneſſe, and glorie.</hi> Wiſedome therefore moderateth beneficence, and beneficence inricheth the wiſe; ſo that through the grace of God, they continuing in benefiting others, proue moſt beneficiall to themſelues in the end.</p>
               <p>Now that it is the ſpeciall grace and commendation of beneficence, that it ſhould be ſo conſiderately diſpoſed, that euerie mans beneficence ſhould not end in one or a fewe benefites, not onely the godly wiſe, but euen the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then wiſe men, haue obſerued. And to this end, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe manie good cautions, for the guiding and directing of liberalitie, leſt after that it hath broken the feruile yoke of niggardly couetouſneſſe, wherein it was vniuſtly detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; it ſhould degenerate into ouer licentious prodigality, or ſome other vnworthy and vnbridled folly. Theſe eauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I thinke it not vnworthy to ſet them downe, as they follow.</p>

               <p>Finally, that in the practiſe of liberality, euery one, to whoſe reliefe it is diſpoſed, be reſpected according as he is more or leſſe worthy for vertue, or in greater or leſſer need through the preſent exigence, as one may ſay, of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like, are the wiſe cautions, which euen heathen men haue ſeene meete to bee obſerued, for the well ordering of liberalitie and beneficence: they all hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that vnaduiſed beneficence is verie diſcommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that euen great giftes ſo beſtowed, are of leſſe worth and reckening, then ſmall benefites wiſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>The ſame cautions and directions, which the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wiſe and ſacred word of God, doth moſt wiſely and perfectly teach, would to God all Chriſtians wold be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to learne and practiſe better then euer the Heathen did. Which verily, by the grace of God they ſhould eaſily do, or at the leaſt not more vnwiſely, to the ſhame of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, if they would hearken to the inſtructions of his word. Then ſhould not the fooliſh hearts of ſo many of vs, be as cloſely drawne together and faſt locked vp as are the ſtrings of our purſes, and the liddes of our boxes and hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when we ſhould doe any good: therein preferring earthly riches which are corruptible and tranſitorie, before the heauenly and eternal treaſures of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: ſo ſetting greater ſtore by worldly friendes, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding, by the well beſtowing of our riches, to prepare our ſelues friendes againſt that great day of account, which God will one day call vs vnto: aſpiring and hunting more after the vaine glorie and pleaſures of this life, then after the ſpirituall ioyes and incorruptible crowne of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Then ſhould not ſo many bee ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as to neglect all practiſe of beneficence, leſt they ſhould (as they pretend) beſtowe it amiſſe ſometime: as though it were not better that almes ſhoulde bee ſometimes loſt and periſh, then anie creature ſhould at

Then ſhould not the vſuall liberalitie of a number bee ſpilt, as it were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon the barren and vnpofitable ground, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath bene, vppon roguiſh, vagabonde, and idle perſons, which nothing at all minded any honeſt courſe of life in obedience either to the lawes of God, or of the lande wherein they liued: yea, which is a thouſande times worſe; then ſhoulde it not bee in anie wiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed of anie to the maintenance of abominable ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and ſuperſtition, and of ſuch as are the wicked inſtrumentes and miniſters thereof, damnable Ieſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Seminarie Prieſtes, &amp;c. For all ſuch beneficence (falſly ſo called) is no true liberalitie, but cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the nature of this moſt noble and free-borne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which implyeth onelye that kind of beſtowing of our goods, which beſt beſeemeth a liberall and free minde indeede: that is, ſuch a minde, as is made free by the Spirite of God, from all ſeruile furtherance of ſinne or ſinners, in anie euill way, and to all willing preferring and aduauncing, onely of true Godlineſſe and Religion, by all the good and holie meanes that it can.</p>
               <p>Finally, if true wiſedome and diſcretion might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes holde the ſterne of Chriſtian beneficence and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, yea, euen there where there is an honeſt and good minde; then not ſo manie, yea rather none at all,

               <p>And thus we may perceiue in a good part, what wiſdom is requiſite to the diſcreet ordering and diſpoſing of euery mans, yea euen of his owne priuate beneficence.

To the which end alſo order ought to be taken, that there might be in ſeuerall Churches a publike treaſurie, wherein publike contributions ſhould be layd vp: and that euery man as he is able, ſhould not only offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing euery time of the holy aſſembly, but that three or foure times of the yeare they ſhould prepare ſome more worthy gift: and concerning the Gouernours of the treaſurie, that it ſhould be their dutie, not onely to diſtribute the ſame, but alſo to giue the Church an account, both what they haue receiued, and what they haue layd out. Neither is there anie reaſon, why any ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they will diſtribute their own goods, as they themſelues ſhould thinke good, in ſo much as it is hard for any to knowe all, and the true ſtate of things is more eaſily found out by men which are purpoſely appointed thereunto: and beſide, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be wiſhed that all things may be done in an orderly courſe then no man can tell how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the diſcreete iudgement and godly aduiſe of that great learned man. And verily, howſoeuer the publike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God doth not take away and ſuppreſſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſpoſing of mens priuate beneuolence, as they ſhal ſee good vpon their owne godly &amp; priuate conſiderations; yet it muſt needs be a great eaſe vnto euery one, touching perſons vnknowne to them, in that they may with good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience leaue them to thoſe who haue the charge of the publike diſtribution. Now as touching that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, concerning that wiſedome and diſcretion which is to be vſed in diſtribution of beneficence, we ſhall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake of it anone.</p>
               <p>The laſt of the three former points, is henceforth to be conſidered of vs; to wit, that it is euery Chriſtians dutie,

There is a very vſual &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon need of mercy, &amp; therefore the commandement is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in generall to all, and particularly to euery one. And when mercie and goodnes hath place in all Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it hath, as it were, the chaire of eſtate in beneficence &amp; liberality: and for the ſame cauſe is aſſigned of God to bee a certaine moderator, and, as it were, the chiefe in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with iuſtice. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee ô man</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Micah) <hi>what is good and what the Lord requireth of thee, Surely to do iuſtice, &amp; to loue mercy.</hi> ch. 6.8. &amp; Zach. 7.9. <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying: Execute ye true iudgement, &amp; ſhew mercy &amp; compaſſion euery man to his brother, &amp;c.</hi> and Pſal. 37.21. <hi>The righteous is merciful and giueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that all are to make practiſe of this grace, reade 1.

And if it be meete that I go alſo they ſhall go with me.</hi> And 2. Cor. 9.7. <hi>As euery man wiſheth in his heart.</hi> And 1. Iohn 3.17. <hi>Whoſoeuer hath this worlds good and ſeeth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue neede, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi> And Epheſ. chap. 4.28. <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteale no more: but let him rather labour and worke with his hands the thing which is good, that he may haue to giue vnto him that needeth.</hi> And when the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12614:26"/> to Iohns baptiſme, asked of him,<note place="margin">Euery man is bound to giue: and that alſo with pitie and compaſſion.</note> what they ſhould do for declaration of their repentance: he anſwered them and ſayd: <hi>He that hath two coates, let him part with him that hath none, and he that hath meate, let him do likewiſe.</hi> Luke chap. 3.11.</p>
               <p>Thus then it is plaine, that all ſtand bound to giue. And not onely ſo, but that which is more, we are further to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that euery one ſtandeth bound according to his ability, and according to all iuſt occaſions offered of God, to doe good; that is, mercifully to ſuccour and relieue all and euery one which ſtandeth in need of our helpe: as the parable of our Sauiour Chriſt ſet downe in the tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Luke, to ſhew who is a mans neighbour, doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare: from the example of that mercifull Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, in his ſuccouring of the diſtreſſed Iew. According alſo to that ſpeech which the Lord vſeth by his Prophete I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, chap. 58.7. <hi>Hide not thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh.</hi> For though there were no more but this bond, that one man is of the ſame fleſh or kind with another; the Lord giueth to vnderſtand, that it ought of it ſelfe to be counted ſufficient reaſon to prouoke any man to deale mercifully with euery one that is of the nature of man. And herein ought euerie one to ſettle his mind to continue vnwearible, ſeeing God himſelfe hath ſo appointed, that the occaſions and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of exerciſing mercie will bee continuall, according to that we read, Deut. 15.11. and more expeſly, Matt. 26.11. where our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Ye ſhall haue the poore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with you.</hi> according alſo to the holy Prouerb. ch. 22.2. <hi>The rich and the poore meete together: the Lord is the maker of them all.</hi> And wherefore is he ſo? No doubt that by the rich he might helpe the poore, and by the poore make triall of the rich, as it is well obſerued &amp; anſwered by a godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles, the ſame our God who commandeth vs to do good vnto all, &amp; that alwayes; he doth ſpecially require that we be chiefly beneficiall to thoſe poore ones, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12614:27"/> be <hi>of the houſhold of faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euery man is bound to giue: and that alſo conſtantly and without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe.</note> Gal. 6 10. And further alſo, euen concerning theſe, though we are to begin to exerciſe our kindneſſe, with the recompencing our kindred, which is noted to be an honeſt thing and acceptable before God. 1. Tim. 5.4. Yet we are not to ſtay there, but to extend our goodneſſe to other our poore neighbours and neare dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; and not onely ſo, but ſometime alſo, euen to ſuch as dwell in places far diſtant from vs: according to that right Chriſtian practiſe whereof we reade Rom. chap. 15. verſ. 24. &amp;c. <hi>When I ſhall take my iourney into Spaine</hi> (ſaith Saint Paule) <hi>I will come to you, &amp;c. But now I go to Ieruſalem to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto the Saints. For it hath pleaſed them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certaine diſtribution vnto the poore Saints which are at Ieruſalem. For it hath pleaſed them, and their deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are they. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are we to ſtay til ſuch as we mind to help be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with extreme neede, and therefore to make delayes; but to take hold of the occaſion, and if it may be, euen to preuent their calamitie. For ſo we haue the precept, Prou. 3.28. <hi>Say not to thy neighbour, Go and come againe, and to morrow will I giue thee, if thou now haue it.</hi> Why ſo? It may be he may die that he cannot come, or though he liue, yet be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from comming againe: or if he do come, thou maiſt be more hardened againſt him then before; or it may be, that thou maiſt bee ſodainly taken away by death from all that thou haſt, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith in the parable to the rich couetous and vnmercifull man.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, far better both in reſpect of themſelues (who taking the time to do well, ſhall reape in due ſeaſon) and more comfortably to others (ſeeing the deferring of the hope is the fainting of the ſoule, but the deſire accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed is as the tree of life) and alſo more to the honour and glorie of God, which is beſt of all doe they, which diſpoſe and giue themſelues to purſue hoſpitalitie, and to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Saints moſt readily; according to that Rom. 12. verſ. 13.

               <p>And that there is ſpeciall regard to be had of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of faith, mentioned before; and among thoſe to ſuch of them chiefly, who being deſtitute by any occaſion, are of ſingular godlines and grace aboue the reſt; there is very great reaſon why it ſhould be ſo: not onely becauſe they are more precious in the ſight of God, but alſo becauſe they of all other are leaſt regarded, yea rather moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſpighted in the world, the children whereof doe only loue and cheriſh their owne. And like wiſe alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reſt, howſoeuer vnbeleeuers muſt be tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the faithfull, though they regard not them; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it, as was ſaid, that almes ſhould be caſt away, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature ſhould periſh for want of reliefe. (In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Chriſtians of the Primitue Churches, euen in the middeſt of the hote rage of their perſecutors,<note place="margin">Read M.

               <p>To conclude this point of our definition, concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans Giuing; it may not be amiſſe, to adde vnto the former conſiderations; that it is a more wiſe courſe, &amp; alſo more agreeable to the nature of true &amp; liuely beneficence, for euery one to giue and diſpoſe with his owne hands, and by the ouerſight of his owne eyes, that which he mindeth to giue, euen in his life time, rather then to leaue all, or the greateſt part to the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his executor after his death. For ſuch gifts are ſubiect to much fraudulent and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing, as experience dayly confirmeth; that we ſay nothing of the opinion of merit, or of the danger of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and praying for the dead, which hath by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome attended that courſe. And beſide, it ſeemeth leſſe commendable in the Church of God, for any to giue his gift, when he can keepe it no longer: and leſſe comfortable to the conſcience of the Giuer in the ſight of God, becauſe he may doubt whether it be rather an extorted or a free gift. Neuertheleſſe, that beneficence which any good Chriſtian bequeatheth by his laſt wil and teſtament (which we may call his funerall beneficence) is not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though the other courſe ſpecially of ſuch as be more rich and wealthy, is to be accounted ſo much the more honourable, by how much it doth more euidently declare both a liuely faith in Gods fatherly prouidence, and alſo a more liuely and pure loue to the brethren: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for excellencie ſake may bee called <hi>

This practiſe of contribution to this ſpeciall end and purpoſe, remained as the ordinance of God to all poſteritie: as we may perceiue by that which we reade Act. 21.24. where the Diſciples ſay to Paul, <hi>Thou ſhalt purifie thy ſelfe &amp; contribute with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the poore; to the ende wee may ſee howe mercifullie louingelie and liberallie the Lord requireth, and the ſame very earneſtlie, that they ſhould be dealt withall; it were good that euerie one ſhould in his beſt earneſt reade the 25. ch. of Leuiticus, and the 15. ch. of Deuteronomie. The which lawes albeit they are now long ſince expired ſo far forth as they were for a time fitted to the externall policie of Iſrael: yet the equitie of them ought to be ſtill in force, and the charge which the Lord giueth touching the ſubſtance of the matter, conteineth morall dutie, whoſe date is equall wth the continuance of the world; and ſtretcheth it ſelfe, as far as there is anie church and people of God to the endes of the earth. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith the Lord in the 15. chap. of Deut. from the 7. verſe) <hi>one of thy brethren with thee be poore, within any of the gates of thy land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee, thou ſhalt not harden thy heart, nor ſhut thy hand from thy poore brother: But thou ſhalt open thine hand vnto him &amp; ſhall lend him ſufficient for his need which he hath. Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thy heart for to ſay, The ſeuenth yeare, the yeare of freedome is at

Thou ſhalt giue him, and let it not grieue thy heart to giue vnto him: for becauſe of this the Lord thy God will bleſſe thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy hand vnto. Becauſe there ſhall euer be ſome poore in the land, therefore I command thee, ſaying: Thou ſhalt open thine hand vnto thy brother, to thy needy and to thy poore in thy land.</hi> Reade alſo Eccleſ. 11.1.2.6. <hi>Caſt thy bread vpon the waters, &amp;c.

When thou ſeeſt the naked that thou couer him, and not hide thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh? Then ſhal thy light breake forth as the morning, &amp;c.</hi> Thus we ſee the commandement of God. We ſee alſo his promiſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: of the which more afterward. Now verily howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be more to mans naturall liking, to doe all the good he doth as a will-worſhip, at his owne pleaſure, where, and when he liſt, to ſerue his owne vaine glorie, and other his corrupt affections and luſtes: yet it is onely to the good liking of the Lord, and to his glory, yea and to our owne benefite alſo, that we performe euery good thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our bounden dutie, according to the holy lawes and commaundements of God. For to ſuch kind of dutie, and namely to ſuch beneficence onely doth the promiſe of Gods bleſſing belong.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, ſeeing the Lord God had ſo grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care for the poore of his people, as we ſaw euen nowe, in the time of the Law; it is in no wiſe to be thought, that he is leſſe carefull for the poore of his Chriſtian Churches, now in the dayes of the Goſpell: nay rather, we haue good reaſon to perſwade our ſelues, that his care is rather more fatherly and tender, according to the more cleare reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12614:30"/> of his own bowellike compaſſion and mercies, by the appearance of his ſonne. No doubt, but both the poore of the Goſpel, who are moſt tenderly loued and pretiouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of the Lord, and alſo the Goſpell it ſelfe which is the moſt bright ſhining wiſedom &amp; the moſt gratious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to the ſaluation of all his people, both poore &amp; rich, they ought more mightily to allure and draw vs all, to ſo much the more willing and bountifull contribution, ſo far as the neceſſities of the poore, and reuerent decencie of the miniſtration of the Goſpell ſhould require.</p>
               <p>And firſt concerning the maintenance of the miniſterie of the Goſpell: <hi>Haue we not power to eate and to drinke,</hi> to wit, at the coſts &amp; charges of the Church, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 9.4. &amp;c. and verſ. 7. &amp;c. <hi>Who goeth on warfare anie time at his owne coſt? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruite thereof? or who feedeth a flocke and eateth not of the milke of the flocke? Say I theſe things according to man? Saith not the lawe the ſame alſo? For it is written in the law of Moſes, Thou ſhalt not nouſell the mouth of the Oxe which treadeth out the corne. Doth God take care for oxen? Either ſaith he it not altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes no doubt it is written, that he which eareth ſhould eare in hope: and that he who thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth in hope ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we haue ſowne vnto you ſpirituall things, is it a great matter if we reape your carnall things?</hi> And verſes 13.14. <hi>Do ye not knowe, that they which miniſter about the holie things, eate of the thinges of the Temple? and they which waite at the altar are partakers with the altar? So alſo hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the Goſpell, ſhould liue of the Goſpell.</hi> This point we ſee is exceedingly laboured, and not onely confirmed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent weight and number of reaſons, and from the diuine authoritie of God himſelfe; but alſo garniſhed by a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue courſe of ſpeech, ſharpened, as it were, with often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed queſtions or interrogations, ſo as it cannot be, but it muſt needes enter and preuaile with euerie one that hath anie ſparkle of true ſpirituall vnderſtanding and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12614:30"/> life of affection in him. And therefore, no maruell though the ſame Apoſtle ſetteth it downe for a lawe to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Galatia, that he who is taught in the word, ſhould make him that hath taught him partaker of all his goods, chap. 6. verſ. 6. Neuertheleſſe, he knowing the diſpoſition of man, to be ouer-bold in eluding and triſling away the commandement of God in this behalfe, he admoniſheth all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beware that they deceiue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, aſſuring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that God will not be mocked nor dallied withal. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo, the holy Apoſtle taketh further occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort earneſtly to willing, liberal, conſcionable, and conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t performance of this dutie without wearineſſe.</p>
               <p>Neither doth he only exhort to this dutie of contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and allowance of all kind of the good things of this life, for the commodious and comfortable maintenance of the Miniſterie and Miniſters of the Goſpell: but likewiſe hee doth in the ſame place earneſtly exhort all of the richer ſort of Chriſtians, to be beneficiall to all that ſtand in neede, ſpecially to the poore Chriſtians, the houſhold ſeruants, or rather children of the ſame familie with them, as hath bene obſerued before.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, notwithſtanding the holy Apoſtle doth thus linke the maintenance of the miniſterie of the Goſpel with the reliefe of the poore; we are neuertheleſſe, to admit that difference betwixt one kind of prouiſion or allowance and the other, which the Lord God himſelf hath put by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his owne word. For the reliefe of the poore is a meere almes, and as one may ſay, a grace or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie of mercie, as touching thoſe that are relieued: who ſeeing they perfourme no ſpeciall ſeruice toward the Church, they can challenge nothing but as of good will, &amp; for the Lords ſake, who becommeth ſurety for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the miniſtery is due as a reward or wages of a worthy ſeruice, according to that prouerbial ſaying which our ſauior Chriſt applieth to this purpoſe, <hi>The laborer is wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy of his wages,</hi> Luk. 10.7. It is true indeed, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12614:31"/> miniſter of the word, or any other, can pleade worthineſſe or deſert at the hands of God, for any ſeruice they are able to performe: for we are all vnprofitable ſeruants to him, &amp; infinitely failing in that wherein wee ſtand bound to him: but in that reckening &amp; account which God alloweth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Miniſters of the Goſpel and the people, our Sauiour Chriſt giueth plainly to vnderſtand, that as euery poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man, when he hath done his day-worke, is worthy of his wages at night (for he doth not receiue his hire as an almes, but as a debt and dutie belonging to him, euen for the worke which he hath done) ſo is the Miniſter of the word worthy of his maintenance, and that in a liberall and comely maner, as may well beſeeme that honourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the people of God do make of the Goſpell of their ſaluation. And in this reſpect doth the Apoſtle Paule (ſpeaking by the ſpirit of our Sauiour Chriſt) note out the maintenance of the miniſtery of the Goſpell, by the title of honour, and not of almes or mercie; ſignifying thereby, with what kind of dutifull affection it ought to be yeelded vnto them, euen for the honour which they beare to the Lord himſelfe. Yea, whereas the Apoſtle calleth the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes allowance, for her inferiour ſeruice to the Church, by the name of honour; it is to marked that he ſaith by an increaſe of ſpeech, that the <hi>Elders,</hi> or Miniſters of the word whoſoeuer labour in that worke, <hi>are ſpecially worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour:</hi> as 1. Tim. 5.2. <hi>Honour widdowes which are wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes indeed.</hi> But verſes 17.18. <hi>The Elders which rule well are worthy of double honour, ſpecially they which labour in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture ſaith, Thou ſhalt not mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne: and the labourer is worthie of his wages.</hi> Chriſtians thus doing ſhall perfourme that which belongeth to them, according to the precept of king Salomon, Prou. chap. 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy riches, and with the chiefe of all thine increaſe.</hi> Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of the ends of Giuing.</p>
               <p>It followeth now that we conſider of that which was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12614:31"/> made the ſecond point of the laſt branch of our definition,<note place="margin">The Rule of Giuing.</note> namely, what muſt be the rule and ſquire, to direct the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and diſpoſing of all Gifts to their right ends.

For this we are to know, that as filthy couetouſnes, with all vnthankfull and vnbeteeming niggardlineſſe, is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable before the Lord, whoſe moſt free and franke boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie infinitely exceedeth all whatſoeuer may poſſibly be yeelded either to him or his: ſo neither can he like that there ſhould be any, either prodigall or immoderate waſt, or any proud, vaine glorious, or hypocriticall oſtentation &amp; pompe in the practiſe of Chriſtian liberalitie: yea or that there ſhould be any indiſcreete ouer-reaching aboue anie any mans condition and ſtate.</p>
               <p>In that great famine which was vnder the Emperour Claudius Caeſar, according as it was foretold by Agabus, who propheſied thereof, Act. 11.28.29. the Diſciples of Antiochia, where they were firſt called Chriſtians, <hi>Euerie man according to his ability ſent ſuccour to the brethren which dwelt in Iudea.</hi> And 2. Cor. 8.13. <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle Paule) <hi>that other men ſhould be eaſed and you grieued. But that your aboundance ſhould ſupply their lacke, &amp;c.</hi> It is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, as hath bene declared already, that euery one ſhould ſo looke to his Ciſterne at home, that all leake not or run out abroad. We haue ſeene alſo, how the Apoſtle requireth ſpeciall care at the hands of euery Chriſtian, for thoſe that do more nearely belong vnto them, 1. Tim. 5.4.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12614:32"/> A worthy example whereof we haue in the Patriarch Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob, Gen. 30. verſe 30. <hi>The little</hi> (ſaith he to Laban) <hi>which thou haddeſt before I came, is increaſed to a multitude: and the Lord hath bleſſed thee by my comming: but now when ſhall I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell for mine owne houſe alſo?</hi> And afterward ch. 42.1.2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaith he to his ſonnes) <hi>I haue heard that there is food in Egypt: get ye downe thither and buy vs food thence, that we may liue and not die.</hi> In the 17. chap. of the firſt of the Kings, the widdow of Zarrephath thinketh it a ſufficient reaſon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Elijah the Prophet ſo much as a morſell of bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her prouiſion for her ſelfe and her child was now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt euen all ſpent: neither could Elijah haue bene further inſtant, had not the Lord ſealed him, as it were, a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aſſure her, that that ſmal remnant of her meale &amp; oile which was left, ſhould not be diminiſhed, though ſhe wold conſent to miniſter food vnto him, euen of the ſame her ſmall ſtore, for the reliefe of his neceſſitie. In the law, the Lord God permitted the richer ſort of his people to gather in the increaſe of the fruits of their owne grounds,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19 10. &amp; chap. 23.22. And more fully Deut. 24.19. &amp;c. Read alſo Exod. 23.10.11</note> to their priuate ſtore houſes and vſes: only he pleadeth thus farre for the poorer ſort that they might for that ſeaſon of the yeare gather ſome helpe toward their reliefe, by the gleanings which ſhould be left. To the which purpoſe, he requireth notwithſtanding, that the ſcatterings of the corne, or other fruit, ſhould not be gathered by the owners ouer neere fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. But touching that ſpeciall care which euery one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to haue ouer his owne family, it is not impertinent here to call to mind that our Sauiour Chriſt in his holy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Luke 15.17. reſembleth the Lord God himſelfe to ſuch a prouident &amp; wiſe houſholder as had bread enough for the meaneſt of his ſeruants, while the prodigall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty ſon, forſaking his fathers houſe, was ready to periſh by famine abroad. The Apoſtles of our Sauiour Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the Chriſtian Churches, the continuance of their contributions without wearineſſe, they do free them from the charge of idle and inordinate perſons, 2. Theſ. 3.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12614:32"/> 6.7.8.9. Finally, for the direction of giuing, our Sauiour Chriſt Matth. 6. warneth all his ſchollers to take heede that they giue not their almes to be ſeene of men, &amp;c. but that they ſhould ſo deale their almes, that their left hand ſhould not know what their right hand did.</p>
               <p>Now likewiſe for our direction how to giue toward the vpholding and aduauncing of the holy worſhip of God: howſoeuer our hearts and our hands ought to be moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and readily inlarged that way: yet it pleaſeth God to let vs vnderſtand, that he neither requireth nor allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of any vnnceſſary ſuperfluity or ſuperſtitious pompe thereunto, as though it were his mind to inrich himſelfe (as one would ſay) and his owne houſe with the pillage and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poueriſhing of his people.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the people of God are ſeldome found in that fault, that they will exceed meaſure toward the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: but rather they delight to dwell themſelues in their ſieled &amp; garniſhed houſes, &amp; to heape vp much riches for their owne priuate vſes, yea euen to ſerue their owne luſtes, though the houſe of God lie waſt, and though all things belonging to his worſhip do, in the meane while, want their conuenient &amp; ſeemly allowance; according to that complaint which the Prophets Haggai and Malachie made againſt the ingratitude of the people in the times they propheſied in. Neuertheles, in ſo much as there haue bene examples of exceeding zeale &amp; forwardnes, the Lord hath thought it good to giue a teſtimony of his gratious moderation in commaunding a ſtay. So we reade, Exod. 36.5.6. <hi>The people</hi> (as Moſes teſtifieth) <hi>brought more then enough for the vſe of the worke of the Tabernacle which he had commaunded. Wherefore</hi> (as it is in the Text) <hi>Moſes gaue a commandement, and they cauſed it to be proclaimed through the hoſte, that they ſhould bring no more.</hi> And whereas afterward, king Dauid in his zeale toward the worſhip and Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Lord, would gladly haue haſted the time of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a glorious Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to the name of the Lord, 1.

               <p>Now, like as the Lord ſo tendereth his people, that hee will not be ouer-burthenſome to them himſelfe, ſo hath he put the like mind into his faithfull ſeruants. As for example, when he returned the captiuitie of his people out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, the holy Prieſt and perfect Scribe of the Lord Ezra, &amp; other the faithfull ſeruantes of God with him (guided no doubt by the holy Ghoſt,) were carefull, leſt they might ſeeme to abuſe, or incroche vpon the bountie of thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes, whoſe hearts God had moued to be already very good and beneficiall to them: and for that cauſe ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in ſome things wherein they had neede of their further aſſiſtance, as we reade in the booke of Ezra, chap. 8.22.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt were likewiſe in ſpecial maner ſparing and tender ouer the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that they might not be ouer burthenſome to them. Nay rather, vpon ſome ſpeciall conſiderations, they would not for the time, require that ordinarie and neceſſary allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance toward their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable maintenance, which was meete. Reade Act. 20.33.34. <hi>I haue coueted no mans ſiluer, nor gold, nor apparell. Yea, ye know that theſe handes haue miniſtred to my neceſſities and to them that were with me.</hi> Read alſo 1.

May not Miniſters of the word require their maintenance at the hands of the people? Yes verily, as hath bene proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And the Apoſtle had already ſayd, <hi>We might haue bene chargeable as the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> 1. Theſ. 2.7. And it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in the text of the ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>Not but that we had authoritie, &amp;c.</hi> His purpoſe is therefore, to ſhew onely what is the part of the Miniſter of the word, as extraordinarie conſiderations and neceſſities may require in the difficult and hard times of the Church: but not to iuſtifie any people in the neglect of their Preachers, of whom they, for their parts, ought to haue an ordinary and honourable care, that they want nothing that is meete for them, on their owne &amp; the Lords behalfe.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, from ſuch examples, and from the whole information of the word of God, not only may the vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gulfe of the couetous &amp; ambitious hierarchie of Rome be worthily condemned: who exceeding their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors the Phariſies, in the worſt times of the degenerate &amp; backſliding Church of the Iewes, haue by infinite deuiſes of ſuperſtition and falſe doctrine, as it were by many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſes and channels, drawne the wealth of all nations into the Popes Exchecquer, like as all riuers runne into the deepe gulfe and belly of the ſea: but alſo the ſame exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may iuſtly admoniſh all true and faithfull Miniſters of

               <p>And thus we may perceiue, how God in his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wiſedome, requiring all good competencie of giftes, neither alloweth any vile &amp; niggardly ſparing, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth any work of ſupererogation to be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him in this buſineſſe. To the one he ſaith: <hi>Go offer it now to thy Prince, will he be content with thee, or accept thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaith the Lord of hoſts?</hi> Mal. chap. 1.6, 7, 8, &amp;c. And to the other he ſaith, <hi>Who required theſe things at thy hands.</hi> Iſai. 1.12. Micah. 6.6.7.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore, I pray you, earneſtly entreat the Lord, that he will vouchſafe to giue all, whom he hath bleſſed with earthly riches in his Church, the grace wiſely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to giue and diſtribute them, according to his, and not their owne blind and inordinate will: remembring that howſoeuer, as the wiſe king ſaith, <hi>Wiſedome is good with an inheritance,</hi> yet wiſely to diſtribute is better then ſurely to hold and poſſeſſe, according to that of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>It is a more bleſſed thing to giue then to receiue:</hi> and therefore not without cauſe beareth the name of a ſingular grace. 2. Cor. 9.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>And finally, to the end all our other gifts which we giue, may be acceptable to God, let vs firſt of all giue our ſelues

               <p>And chap. 17.7. Iaſon, a citizen of Theſſalonica, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Paule and Silas into his houſe.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:12614:39"/>
               <p>And chap. 21.16. Mnaſon an ancient Diſciple of Cyprus is an hoſt of the brethren.</p>
               <p>And chap. 28.2. it is a very memorable record, that God prouideth ſo for Paule and his weatherbeaten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, that the Barbarians ſhewed them no ſmall kindneſſe, in that, as Saint Luke reporteth, they tooke them to houſe, and made them a good fire, to comfort them againſt the cold and wet of the raine.</p>
               <p>And verſ. 7. The chiefe man of the ſame Ile called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita, whoſe name was Publius, receiued and lodged them three dayes very curteouſly. Yea, verſe 10. it is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Euangeliſt, that they did them great honour, and that when they departed, they laded them with things neceſſarie. This ſurely was rare kindneſſe, for ſo rude and barbarous a place, as it might ſeeme to haue bene.</p>
               <p>In the 15. chap. to the Romanes, verſes 25.26. &amp;c. The Chriſtians of the countryes of Macedonia and Achaia ſend their contribution to the poore Saints, which are far diſtant from them, euen at Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>And againe, 2. Cor. 8. The Apoſtles Iames, and Cephas, and Iohn gaue warning to Paule and Barnabas, that they ſhould remember the poore: <hi>Which thing</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paule) <hi>I was willing to do.</hi> Gal. 2.9.10.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe Phil. 4.10.14.15.16. The Chriſtians of Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi haue this comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, that they did ſundry times ſend reliefe to the Apoſtle Paule, when he was in affliction and want.</p>
               <p>And 1. Theſ. 1.3. The diligent loue of the Chriſtians of that Church hath the honourable teſtimonie of the ſame Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>And 2. Tim. 1.16.17.18. <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> (as Paule acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth with great thankfulneſſe) <hi>he often refreſhed him, and miniſtred many things to him for his comfort, both at Epheſus, and alſo at Rome, ſeeking him vp there, and that without being aſhamed of his chaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the epiſtle to Philemon, Paule giueth witneſſe, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12614:39"/> Philemon abounded in loue to the Saints, and that by him their hearts were comforted.</p>
               <p>Heb. 6.10. The Apoſtle teſtifieth that many among the Chriſtian Iewes were verie louing and careful in a conſtant courſe in relieuing their poore brethren. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>is not vnrighteous that he ſhould forget your worke, and labour of loue, which ye haue ſhewed toward his name, in that ye haue miniſtred to the Saints, and yet do miniſtr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the third epiſtle of the Apoſtle Iohn, Gaius hath ſpeciall commendation, to haue bene a bountifull hoſt vnto the Church, as one greatly helpfull to the truth, in that he gaue entertainment, not onely to the Chriſtians which he had acquaintance withall, but alſo to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which were ſtrangers, whenſoeuer by any occaſion of trauell, they had need to reſort vnto him. And great, no doubt, was the loue and readineſſe of Gaius, which gaue modeſt ſtrangers incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to vſe ſo great boldneſſe, as to come ſo commonly vnto him.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Chriſtians of the Church of Thyatira (as our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe teſtifieth of them) they were more at the laſt then at the firſt in the workes of faith, and loue, and of patience. <hi>I know thy workes</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>and thy loue, and ſeruice, &amp; faith, and thy patience, &amp; thy works, and that they are more at the laſt then at the firſt.</hi> Reuel. chap. 2.19.</p>
               <p>In the which example, worthily may we now reſt, for the ſhutting vp of this our holy catalogue of all ſortes of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; true worſhippers of God for the moſt part, and ſome alſo among the heathen, being yet heathniſh; whom neuertheleſſe God directed ſo gratiouſly in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions, that they may therin be iuſtly exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples among the reſt, and that euen to Chriſtians, to prouoke them to beneficence, vnleſſe they will ſuffer themſelues to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, if they ſhould be more vnkind in like caſes of Gods glorie, or in any humane neceſſities, then they haue bene. And this let vs marke, that in theſe examples
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12614:40"/> recorded as we haue ſcene in the holie Scriptures;<note place="margin">Contrary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> both touching the one ſorte, and the other, we haue the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of all kinde of beneficence, as well toward religion it ſelfe, as all true worſhippers of God; yea toward euerie one that ſhall ſtand in need of our helpe, whether in feeding, clothing, lodging, or by anie other way and meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing and comforting of them, according to our power: ſo that if we haue grace, nothing is wanting, for our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and incouragement, to be right chriſtian imitators and followers of them therin.</p>
               <p>Nowe brieflie (for the concluſion of this chapter) let vs in a ſhort view gather together the vices to be auoided, as contrarie to godlie and Chriſtian beneficence: They are of two ſortes, either altogether hindering; or at the leaſt corrupting and peruerting true beneficence. The vices altogether hindering, are couetouſenes, churliſhnes, a grudging and repining affection, the which ariſing from couetouſneſſe, is ioyned alſo with a baſe account, both of God, and of his worſhip, and of his people: as if all were too much, and too good, yea as if all were loſt and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, whatſoeuer is ſo imployed &amp; beſtowed. Of all which we haue had Nabal for a notorious example. But beſide theſe, there are alſo other vices of this former ſort; as diſtruſt in Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, truſt in a mans owne forecaſt, ſelf-loue, pride, voluptuouſneſſe, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the vices which corrupt and peruert Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an beneficence, they are in the worſer ſort of men hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, ioyned with colourable couetouſneſſe, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of franke and free liberalitie, like to that of Ananias &amp; Sapphira his wife, Act. 5. And together with hypocriſie, vaine glorie, in hunting after the praiſe of men, and proud conceit of worthineſſe and merit, euen before God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: alſo when beneficence (if ſo it may be called) is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to countenance and aduance idolatrous religion, or ſuperſtitious traditions and ceremonies in the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: furthermore, when almes is giuen of ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12614:40"/> goods; ſpecially, if they be giuen with a mind to make ſatisfaction to God, for the fraud which hath bene done to men: laſt of all, when anie thing is giuen with a mind, expecting and longing after a like or greater worldlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. Theſe are then corrupting vices in the worſer ſort of men. And in the better ſort they may be theſe which follow: firſt, indiſcreete and waſtfull giuing, as to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit poore, or to vagrant and inordinate perſons, with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſuch as be poore honeſt inhabitants and houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: ſecondly, a ſecure preſumption in Gods prouidence, with neglect of prayer to God for the vpholding of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and without due regard of vſing diligence in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our callings, and without thriftie employing of commodities to the beſt aduantages, ſuch as be honeſt &amp; lawfull, or when any do put forth themſelues aboue their abilitie: finally, neglect of thankfulneſſe to God for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bleſſing and proſperity.</p>
               <p>All which vices, partly as open &amp; profeſſed aduerſaries and deſtroyers; and partly, as ſecrete &amp; vndermining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators: they muſt be both mightilie and alſo warily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and preuented of all ſuch, as mind not only to enter, but alſo hold out conſtant, in the right Chriſtian courſe of this excellent and noble vertue of godly beneficence, the which God hath ſo gratiouſly commanded and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs: and which his ſeruants haue obediently tracked and troden forth before vs. Thus finiſhing this ſecond chapter, let vs proceede to the reſt of our Treatiſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing God, who is of infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, moſt rich and bountifull in all good gifts and graces, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all ſuch as haue Gods plentie, (as it is commonly and rightly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) that they be liberall in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and ſeeing he promiſeth alſo that hee will of his diuine bountie, reward the ſame: it cannot be, but that he will indeed plentifully recompence all ſuch, as ſhall obey the ſame his holy commandement, and will beleeue that gratious promiſe which he hath made in this behalfe. This therefore, let vs now henceforth conſider in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the end that hereby (through the bleſſing of God) we may both helpe forward this vertue in the heartes and hands of thoſe that be ouer-ſlack &amp; negligent; and alſo that we may comfort and incourage both heart and hand of all, which by the grace of God are already prompt and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that they may neuer waxe faint and weary, till they haue attained to the full recompence of that moſt gratious and free reward, which from the bounteous &amp; neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried heart and hand of the Lord is thereunto promiſed and aſſured.</p>
               <p>In ſpeaking of which free bleſſing of reward let vs hold the ſame order which was obſerued in treating of the duty.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:12614:41"/>
               <p>Firſt therfore, concerning thoſe which are liberall in ſuch manner as hath bene deſcribed; to the maintenance of Gods pure religion and worſhip, and for the ſame cauſe, haue anie ſpeciall care, to incourage and further the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſters of the word of God, in their holie miniſterie, or anie other of Gods faithfull ſeruantes: let vs ſee howe the reward of ſuch is aſſured vnto them: firſt from thoſe promiſes, which the Lord, who is a rewarder of all that ſeeke him, hath made vnto them: &amp; then from ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in whom he hath giuen experience and teſtimonie to his Church, in the faithfull perfourmance of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, let vs conſider what our Sauiour Chriſt (in whom and by whom all the promiſes of God are yea and Amen) ſpeaketh to this purpoſe in the tenth chap. of Matth. verſes 40, 41, 42. <hi>He that receiueth you</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt to his diſciples, whom he minded to employ in the preaching of his Goſpell) <hi>receiueth me: and he that receiueth me, receiueth him that ſent me. He that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhall receiue a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and he that receiueth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receiue the reward of a righteous man. And whoſoeuer ſhall giue vnto one of theſe little ones, to drinke a cup of cold water onely, in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay vnto you, he ſhall not looſe his reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the which words of our Sauiour Chriſt two things are principally to be obſerued. Firſt, what euery one is chiefly to reſpect in his Chriſtian beneficence toward the ſpeciall ſeruants of God: yea, toward any of the leaſt of thoſe that beare and profeſſe his name: that is, that in giuing vnto them, or in ſhewing anie other kindneſſe, they do not ſo much reſpect their perſons, as the Goſpell and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and thoſe goodly gifts of godlineſſe, wherwith he hath graced and adorned his ſeruants, for the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of his Chuch in the communion of Saints. For that our Sauiour Chriſt meaneth by giuing to a Prophet in the name of a Prophet; and to a righteous man in the name of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12614:42"/> a righteous man; and to a little one in the name of a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as though he ſhould ſay, euen for the loue that a man beareth them, becauſe they be ſuch as they be; either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as in a principall place of ſeruice, or a rigteous man, as one more ancient and approued in his profeſſion, or a Diſciple, as it were a nouice, or new conuerted and more weake Chriſtian. This is the firſt thing to be obſerued in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to obſerue, that according to the qualitie and degree of the dutie which any perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in that former reſpect, the rewarde of Gods free bountie ſhall bee proportionable; that is, he will fit the crowne anſwerable to the worke of his owne grace, and according to the excellencie of the occaſions, which he himſelfe vouchſafeth to giue; whether greater or leſſer, and according to the greater or leſſer meaſure of faith and loue, wherein the ſame duties are perfourmed and continued in: yet ſo, as the leaſt kindneſſe done in truth, ſhall be requited with manifold aduantage.</p>
               <p>In the 6. ch. of the Epiſtle to to the Galathians from the 6. verſe &amp;c. the Apoſtle Paule, in the name of Chriſt, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing charge to the Chriſtian Churches, that they prouide for the maintenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpell, euen as they will anſwere the matter before God, who will not be dallied with therein, as we haue ſeene before: he doth therewithall aſſure all ſuch as ſhal deale Chriſtianly herein, that they ſhall reape a plentifull fruit from the ſame. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a man ſoweth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that ſhall he alſo reape. For he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the the fleſh reap corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that is, he that mindeth earthly things, without regard of Gods kingdome and religion, and his owne ſaluation, he ſhall periſh with them: <hi>but he that ſoweth to the Spirit,</hi> that is, he which doth liberally contribute to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and aduancement of the miniſterie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>ſhall of the Spirit reape life euerlaſting. Let vs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:12614:42"/> (as the holie Apoſtle exhorteth) <hi>bee vvearie of vvell-doing: for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reape, if vvee faint not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwerable hereunto, is that charge which the ſame Apoſtle giueth vnto Timotheus, and ſo to all faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpell, in the laſt chapter of that his firſt Epiſtle: <hi>Charge thoſe that bee rich in this world</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they be not high minded, and that they truſt not in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God (who giueth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly all things to enioy) That they doe good, and bee rich in good vvorkes, and readie to diſtribute and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. Laying vp in ſtore for themſelues a good foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reade alſo in the firſt chapter of the Prophete Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai. verſe 8. <hi>Goe vp to the mountaine, and bring wood, and build this houſe, and I will be fauourable in it, and I will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And againe, chap. 2. verſes 19.20. <hi>Conſider I pray you in your mindes, from this day, and afore, from the foure and twentith day of the ninth moneth, euen from the day that the foundation of the Lords temple was layd: conſider it in your mindes, Is the ſeede yet in the barne? As yet the vine, and the figge tree, and the pomegranet and oliue tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bleſſe you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe in the ſecond chapter of the propheſie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie verſes 10.11.12. <hi>Bring ye all the tithes into the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, that there may be meate in my houſe, and proue me now herewith, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, if I will not open the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of heauen vnto you, and poure ye out a bleſſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure. And I will rebuke the deuourer for your ſakes, and he ſhall not deſtroy the fruite of your ground, neither ſhall your vine be barren in the field, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes. And all nations ſhall call you bleſſed: for ye ſhall be a pleaſant land, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I pray ye, let vs marke how, when the Lord, Ier. 32.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12614:43"/> from the 17. verſe and throughout the whole 33. chapter: and likewiſe Ezek. chap. 36.25.26. &amp;c. ſpeaketh of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his people Iſrael from their captiuitie to their owne land, that they might inioy the fruitfull bleſſings thereof, as in former times; he maketh the renewing of their hearts to his feare and worſhip, the forerunner of the ſame, and this bleſſing to be a conſequent of that: according to the ancient promiſe of bleſſing, to thoſe that ſhould truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. Leuit. 26.3. &amp;c. and Deut. 28.1.2. &amp;c. to the 15. verſe.</p>
               <p>But this promiſe of bleſſing was not made onely to the people of God vnder the law, vpon condition they would performe faithfull ſeruice and worſhip to God: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to all nations and people whoſoeuer, being at any time called to the true knowledge of God, ſhall yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in the faith of Chriſt, true worſhippers of him; as we are ſweetly taught and aſſured in the 67. Pſalme. For this being the praier which the holy Ghoſt teacheth the church to pray in that Pſalme: <hi>That all nations might knowe God, and ioyfully praiſe and worſhip him:</hi> the concluſion followeth, with this moſt gratious and bounteous promiſe of God: <hi>Then ſhall the earth bring forth her increaſe, and God euen our God ſhall bleſſe vs. God ſhall bleſſe vs, and all the ends of the earth ſhall feare him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, Matth. 6.33. <hi>Seeke ye firſt the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be caſt vnto you:</hi> to wit, as an ouerplus, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to make vp more then meaſure or tale; as a matter of ſmall reckening in ſo great an account, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is the ſame alſo, which the faithfiull Apoſtle of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt affirmeth, 1. Timoth. 4.8. <hi>Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of the life preſent, and of that which is to come.</hi> For no man can truly and hartily ſeeke the kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſſe, and ſo be a right godly man indeed, but the ſame muſt, and will be to his power, a willing maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and furtherer of the true worſhip of God, and of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12614:43"/> faithfull ſeruants, the publike miniſters thereof. Thus much for the promiſe of bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The examples doe now followe, concerning the ſame bleſſing of God, vpon ſuch as haue had ſuch a zealous care of furthering his worſhip, as hath bene ſpoken of. The examples which we mind to bring forth, they are partly of ſuch perſons as ſhewe that they had a perſwaſion in their hearts by faith, that God would in mercie recompence their ſeruice, this way done to him and his Church: &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are ſuch, vpon whom the bleſſing of God, actually poured downe vpon them, is more expreſly teſtified and recorded in the holy word of God.</p>
               <p>Of the faith of the former ſort, we may take Dauid, in his prayer of faith, for a worthy example. Pſalm. 86.2. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue my ſoule, for I am mercifull: ſaue thou thy ſeruant that truſteth in thee. Be mercifull vnto me ô Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe godly Nehemia, that zealous furtherer of Gods true worſhip and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is another moſt worthy example, as we may porceiue by his moſt humble &amp; faithfull pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, chap. 13. verſ. 14. in theſe words: <hi>Rememember me ô my God herein, and wype not out my kindneſſe that I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the houſe of my God, and on the offices thereof.</hi> And againe in the ſame chapter, verſe 22. after that he had reformed the abuſe and prophanation of the Lords Sabbath: <hi>Rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me ô my God, concerning this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and pardon me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy great mercy.</hi> The honorable good man praieth, as we ſee, for Gods bleſſing, as one hauing a liuely faith in his promiſe: but he as well as Dauid ſhew by their prayers, that they are farre rmoued from the pride of the Iuſticiarie, who preſumeth vpon his merit, and ſo maketh himſelfe in his beſt workes abominable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>In like manner with Dauid and Nehemiah, had king Hezekiah a comfortable perſwaſion, that God wold ſhew him mercy, becauſe he had ſhewed kindneſſe to the houſe of God, and to his ſeruants the miniſters therof. Yea, it was as a ſweet refuge and ſanctuarie to his ſoule, when he was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12614:44"/> in that deepe diſtreſſe, which the bitterneſſe of his ſickneſſe had brought vpon him as, we read, 2. King. chap. 20.2.3. <hi>I beſeech thee ô Lord</hi> (ſaith that godly King) <hi>remember nowe how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy ſight: and Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah wept ſore.</hi> Now what this goodneſſe was, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof was ſo comfortable to his conſcience in the time of his diſtreſſe, it appeareth at large, in the 29. 30. and 31. chap. of the ſecond booke of holy Chronicles: and more briefly is the ſame compriſed in the two laſt verſes of the 31. ch. after this maner. <hi>And thus did Hezekiah through out all Iadah, and he did well, and vprightly &amp; truly before the Lord his God. And in all the workes which he began for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the houſe of God, both in the Law &amp; in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to ſeeke his God, he did it with all his heart and proſpered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like remembrance of beneficence to the Lords Prophetes, gaue Obadiah a ſtrong perſwaſion to plead with the Prophete Elijah, that he would deale well with him, &amp; not endanger his life to the wrath of his maſter; king Ahab: and Elijah dealeth with him accordingly, as with one, in the ſame reſpect, worthy to be tendered for the Lords cauſe. 1. King. 18.13. &amp;c. <hi>Was it not told my Lord</hi> (ſaith Obadiah) <hi>what I did, when Iezabel ſlew the Prophetes of the Lord, how I hid a hundreth of the Lords Prophetes by fiftie in a caue, and fed them with bread and water? And now thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt go tell thy Lord, behold Elijah is here, that he may ſlay me,</hi> For Obadiah feared leſt Elijah would haue conueyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe away, and ſo king Ahab thinking himſelfe mocked, ſhould be inraged againſt Obadiah. Whereupon Elijah aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth him verſe ſolemnly by oath, that he would ſhewe himſelfe to Ahab that day.</p>
               <p>Yea further, the practiſe of this kind of beneficence, is ſo notable a fruite of faith, that iuſtly doth it confirme the faith of others to expect mercie from God vpon them that exerciſe the ſame, as we ſee, how from the ſame incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the Apoſtle Paule prayed for Oneſiphorus, his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12614:44"/> moſt kind and conſtant, benefactor: <hi>The Lord giue mercie to the houſe of Oneſiphorus</hi> (ſaith Paule) <hi>for he oft refreſhed me, and was not aſhamed of my chaine. But when he was at Rome he ſought me vp diligently and found me. The Lord grant vnto him that he my find mercie with the Lord at that day.</hi> 2. Tim. 1.16.17.18. Now there is no doubt, but the ſame Spirit which ſet Paule on worke to pray thus for Oneſiphorus, minded alſo to grant the ſame his requeſt, both for him &amp; his houſe. The like is to be conceiued of his prayer for the Philippians vpon the ſame occaſion: he nothing doubting, but that their contribution to his maintenance, was an odour that ſmelleth ſweet, a ſacrifice acceptable and pleaſant to God, chap. 4.17.18.19.20.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to open and confirme this point, by a few more expreſſe and plaine examples, ſuch as God hath made, by euident effect of his mercie vpon them, famous ſpectacles of his bounty, in reſpect of their kind and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall dealing, either toward his worſhip, or any Miniſters thereof, for his ſake, yea though they haue not ſo hartily minded the ſame as they ought to haue done.</p>
               <p>The widdow of Zarephath, who gaue entertainment to the Prophet Elijah, receiued this great bleſſing by the hand of the Lord, by his meanes, that the ſmall quantitie of her oyle and meale did not diminiſh, all the time that the dearth and ſcarcitie continued in Iſrael. And beſide that, by meanes of the ſame Prophet ſhe receiued againe he ſon from death to life. 1. King. 17.15.</p>
               <p>The honourable Shunamite alſo, who gaue entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Prophet Eliſha, as was rehearſed before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing barren, at the prayer of Eliſha, God gaue her power to conceiue: and afterward alſo, at his prayer, ſhe receiued the ſame her ſonne from death to life, as the widdow of Zare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phath had done by the prayer of Elijah, 2. King. chap. 4. verſ. 8. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the 39. chap. of Gen. we reade that the Lord bleſſed Potiphars houſe, though a heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, for Ioſephs ſake, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:12614:45"/> from the time that he preferred him to be the Gouernour of it. And afterward, he was alſo a bleſſing to Pharaoh, and all his people, by reaſon that he aduanced him to the chiefe honour of his kingdome, next vnder himſelfe. For by that occaſion God made Ioſeph their foſter-father in the ſeuen yeares of famine, yea and the foſter-father of his Church, the familie of his owne father, which alſo was Ioſephs own bleſſing, in ſo much as he was found faithfull to God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Neither is there any doubt, but the Lord ſhewed great mercie to Nebuchadnezzar, becauſe he fauoured and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced his holy Prophet Daniel, and ſome other the verie faithfull ſeruants of God, who were his captiues in Babel. Publius alſo the chiefe man of the Ile Melita, of the which we read before, he giuing the Apoſtle Paule and the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt Luke curteous entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for three dayes, through the goodneſſe of God he receiued an Apoſtles reward. For by Paule his father was healed of a grieuous feuer, and of the bloudy fluxe, yea, &amp; diuers other of that place were healed of their diſeaſes. Act. 28.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the Lord bleſſed heathen men, for their preferring of his ſeruants and Prophetes to honour, therein they chiefly reſpected their owne pleaſure &amp; contentment: ſhal we not much rather aſſure our ſelues, that whoſoeuer among Chriſtians ſhall, for the loue and honour which they vnfeinedly beare to God, and his pure religion, deale honorably with his ſeruants, the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his word and Goſpel, ſhall much rather be bleſſed and proſpered of him? It is out of queſtion that we may. Do we not read that the Lord greatly bleſſed Obed Edom and all that had, becauſe he religiouſly receiued, and kept the Arke in his houſe by the ſpace of that three moneths, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Dauid was diſcouraged, by reaſon of the ſtrange iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon Vzziah, as the holy ſtorie ſheweth more at large, 1. Chron. 13? And againe 2. Chron. 11.13.14.15.16.17. Do we not read, that when Rehoboam gaue entertainment to the holy Leuites, &amp; Godly minded Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12614:45"/> who from among the other tribes of Iſrael, left their ſuburbes and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſeſſions, and came to Ieruſalem, to auoid that idolatrous and ſuperſtitious worſhip, which Ieroboam had ſet vp; <hi>they ſetting their heartes to ſeeke the Lord God of Iſrael, and to offer to the Lord God of their fathers:</hi> Doe we not reade, I ſay, that hereby the kingdome of Iudah was ſtrengthened, and that Rehoboam the ſonne of Salomon was made mightie three yeeres long: that is, euen ſo long as they walked in the way of Dauid and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the text affirmeth?</p>
               <p>An experiment alſo hereof we haue in the ſame booke, chap. 31.4. &amp;c. King Hezekiah commanded the people, which dwelt in Ieruſalem, to giue a part to the Prieſtes and Leuites, that they might be incouraged in the lawe of the lord. And it is there teſtified, that after the people had done ſo, <hi>the Lord bleſſed his people, and the land with great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> verſe 10.</p>
               <p>And hath not our bleſſed Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her whole Dominion, had plentifull experience, how good it is, to giue intertainement to baniſhed churches and perſecuted Chriſtians, whom God hath ſent for ſuccour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs?

So no doubt, as king Salomon truly ſaith, <hi>They that honour the Lord with their riches, and with the chiefe of all their increaſe, Their barnes ſhall be filled with aboundance, and their preſſes ſhall burſt</hi> (to wit, as being worne out with preſſing ſo great aboundance of grapes) <hi>to make new wine,</hi> Pro. 3.9.10.</p>
               <p>Micah of mount Ephraim, hauing entertained a Leuite to be a Prieſt in his houſe, he incourageth himſelfe to think and ſay thus: <hi>Now I know that the Lord will be good vnto me, ſeeing I haue a Leuite to be my Prieſt,</hi> Iudg. 17.10.13.

And ſo may all perſwade themſelues, that, if the fault be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in themſelues, God will be good vnto them when they maintaine his faithfull Miniſters to preach his Goſpell vnto them. Hetherto therefore, of the bleſſing of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beneficiall contribution, and liberall giuing toward the maintenance of the holy worſhip and ſeruice of God: &amp; of the faithfull miniſters thereof, or toward the reliefe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of any other of his ſpeciall good ſeruants.</p>
               <p>It followeth now, that we ſhew that it is the good will and pleaſure of God in like maner, to reward the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberality and beneficence of thoſe, that are good to the pooreſt and leaſt of his Saints, as a fruit of their loue, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the former zeale of Gods glorie in the furthering and aduancing of his pure worſhip and religion. For this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath manifold witneſſe and confirmation in the word of God, both by promiſes from the ſacred mouth of God, and alſo from examples, as it were by the reaching forth of the hand, to let vs euidently perceiue, that it is his verie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full purpoſe gratiouſly to recompence the ſame. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as before, ſo againe here, let vs firſt conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and this being done, then let vs take a view of the examples.</p>
               <p>In the 24 chap. of Deut. verſe 13. The Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that mercie be ſhewed to the poore, he ſaith, that it <hi>ſhall be righteouſnes before him</hi> to them that ſhall do it. If it be accepted for righteouſnes in the ſight of God, there is no doubt but he will in mercy reward it. And let vs note, that in this place of Deut. the Lord ſpeaketh of mercifulneſſe in lending, which is a degree of mercy inferiour to franke and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12614:46"/> free giuing. Wherefore,<note place="margin">The reward of giuing to the poore.</note> ſeeing God will reward merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in free lending, much rather will he account the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of free giuing for a ſpeciall kind of righteouſnes, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, he wil more aboundantly reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence &amp; reward it. So Deut. 15.7. &amp;c. (which place was alleaged before) the Lord comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding not only to lend freely, but alſo to giue, promiſeth hereupon that he will bleſſe ſuch as ſhal obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement in <hi>all their works, and in al that they put their hand vnto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 112. Pſ. verſ. 6.9.10. <hi>Surely</hi> (ſaith the Spirit of God by his holy Prophet and Pſalmiſt) <hi>a good man ſhall neuer be moued: the righteous ſhall be had in euerlaſting reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. He hath diſtributed and giuen to the poore: his righteouſneſſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for euer, his horn ſhall be exalted with glorie, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, God will mightily bleſſe and vphold his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, againſt all the enuious repinings, &amp; malignant inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of the wicked whatſoeuer. For as it followeth in the Pſalm, <hi>The wicked ſhall ſee it &amp; be angry, he ſhall gnaſh with his teeth and conſume away, the deſire of the wicked ſhall periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 37. Pſalme, the holy prophet guided by the ſame Spirit, and wiſely obſeruing, by his owne experience, the gratious courſe of Gods moſt holy prouidence, in that he tenderly watcheth alwayes ouer his good, righteous and merciful ſeruants: he is bold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame his obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to giue out as a principle, that God will neither forſake the righteous, nor yet their godly ſeed &amp; poſterity after them. <hi>I haue bin yong</hi> (ſaith he, ver. 25.26) <hi>&amp; now I am old, yet I neuer ſaw the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread. He is euer mercifull and lendeth, and his ſeed inioyeth the bleſſing.</hi> And K. Salomon, Pou. 13.22 <hi>The good man ſhall giue inheritance to his children children: and the riches of the ſinner is layd vp for the iuſt.</hi> There is therefore a double bleſſing attending vpon the mercifull: that is, both vpon themſelues, and alſo vpon their children and poſterity: and therefore alſo, may it iuſtly be a double incouragement to moue al Chriſtians to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and conſtant courſe in this kind of weldoing.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:12614:47"/>
               <p>Not that euer any, which is the child of a righteous man, may not come to beggers ſtate, or to bee exerciſed for a time with outward wants: for it is eaſily ſeene that the leud, ſlothfull and vnthrifty ſonne of a good man doth fall into miſerable pouertie, as a iuſt puniſhment vpon him; yea euen the rather, becauſe he hauing had ſo good an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before his eyes, and the benefite of good education doth notwithſtanding refuſe to walke in the good ſteps &amp; counſels of his godly father.</p>
               <p>Neither is it ſo to be vnderſtood, as though no godly child of a righteous man, may at any time ſuffer outward aduerſitie and want: for this alſo doth the Lord alſo worke ſometimes in our ſight, for ſecret cauſes knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to the end he may worke greater things by them and for them, then outward proſperitie could afford. But the meaning of the Prophete is, that neither the righeous, nor their godly ſeed, ſhall be forſaken of God, or vtterly left deſtitute of mans ſuccour in their penurie and want of all things; though for a ſeaſon it may fall vpon them for their triall: and then that the vſuall and ordinarie courſe of Gods dealing is to ſhew mercie vpon ſuch, yea euen the mercie and bleſſing of this preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Furthermore, Pſalm. 41. ver. 1. &amp;c. The ſame holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete of God pronounceth thoſe bleſſed, who ſhall iudge wiſely of the poore and afflicted. And yet this is in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance leſſe then to deale kindly and mercifully toward them. Neuertheleſſe, how little ſo euer it may ſeeme to be, yet it is in truth a principall grace, greatly ſeruing to all externall exerciſe of mercie and compaſſion, how ſecrete and hidden ſoeuer it be. For where there is firſt of all, a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable iudgement conceiued of thoſe that be humbled by any affliction, there will follow comfortable counſell, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prayer, and euery other good fruite of compaſſion and mercie, in hope that God will in due time deliuer and ſaue them out of all their affliction. For ſo it followeth in the Pſalme. <hi>The Lord will deliuer him in time of trouble. The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12614:47"/> Lord will keep him and preſerue him aliue: he ſhall be bleſſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and thou (ô God) wilt not deliuer him vnto the will of his enemies. The Lord will ſtrengthen him vpon the bed of ſorrow: thou</hi> (he turneth his ſpeech again to God as before) <hi>haſt turned all his bed in his ſickneſſe:</hi> or haſt put an end to his diſeaſe or ſickneſſe. Thus, as the holy Prophet giueth to vnderſtand, will ſuch as iudge wiſely and charitably of the afflicted, bemone their eſtate, and comfort them all they can: and that with as much chearefulneſſe as they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their heartes vnto, from ſuch good and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſons, as are mentioned in the Pſalme.</p>
               <p>And now, in all this, what doth this Prophet ſay, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimony of the holie Scripture affirme, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt doth not confirme, in that he ſaith, Mat. 5.7. <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercie.</hi> And ch. 25.34. &amp;c. The king (ſaith he, ſpeaking of himſelfe) euen the Iudge of all the world, ſhall ſay to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on his right hand at the laſt day: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit ye the kingdome prepared for ye from the foundations of the world. For I was hungrie and ye gaue me meate, I thirſted and ye gaue me drinke, &amp;c.</hi> and verſe 40. <hi>In ſo much as ye haue done it to the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye haue done it to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how great and incomprehenſible ſhall this comfort be to all thoſe that ſhall attaine vnto it, ſeeing it ſhall be the euerlaſting ſealing vp of all comfort, and of moſt glorious happineſſe vnto them! And therefore alſo, howe worthie the obtaining of this, is all the care of forecaſting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration that may be?

To this purpoſe well ſerueth that which S. Iohn writeth, Reuel. 14.13. <hi>I heard a voyce from heauen, ſaying vnto me, write: Bleſſed are the dead, euen henceforth, which die in the Lord. Euen ſo ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and that their workes may follow them.</hi> Of the which works, no doubt, theſe of mercy which we ſpeak of, are a chiefe and principall part, according to that of the Prophet Iſaiah chap. 57.1.2. <hi>Mercifull men are takes away from the euill to come. They enter into peace and reſt in their graues.</hi>

               <p>Theſe things being ſo, let it be ſo farre from vs, to thinke it too great a matter to part with a ſmall portion of our worldly goods, to the reliefe of our poore brethren; that we may rather eſteeme it a ſmall thing, in compariſon of the kingdome of heauen, which our Sauiour Chriſt is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to giue vnto vs, Luke 12.33.34. though we ſhould ſel all that we haue, if need ſo required, &amp; giue it out for almes.

               <p>And to the ſame purpoſe, let vs willinglie hearken to that holy inſruction, which the ſame our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour teacheth vs in the 14. chap. of the ſame Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſaying: <hi>When thou makeſt a dinner or a ſupper, call not

But when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blind: and thou ſhalt be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe they cannot recompence thee: for thou ſhalt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced at the reſurrection of the iuſt.</hi> Not that our Sauiour Chriſt doth ſimply condemne or forbid all ciuill inuiting and feaſting of one rich friend by another, in a mutuall and anſwerable courſe of kindneſſe, ſo it be ſoberly practiſed: but he mindeth onely to ſhew in theſe wordes, that the feaſting of the poore is much to be preferred before the feaſting of the rich, ſpecially of the good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poore; in ſo much as this kind of feaſting is both more neceſſarie, in regard of the gueſts, which do ſtand in need to be this way refreſhed: as alſo becauſe it is leſſe chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the feaſt-maker, in that a more meane diet will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the poore: and finally, becauſe it is more gainefull, in that the bleſſing of the kingdome of heauen doth belong to this kind of mercifull feaſting, and not to that other feaſting of the rich, which is continually recompenced by one to the other here in this world, as our Sauiour giueth to vnderſtand.</p>
               <p>Nowe further, if wee will vſe but a little more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to peruſe the holy Prouerbes of king Salomon, we ſhall find in that one little booke ſo manie, and the ſame ſo excellent ſentences, tending this way, as may worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirme vs greatly in the ſure hope of the bleſſing of God, while we doe walke in this bleſſed way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie toward the poore and needie. Of theſe excellent ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences therefore, let vs here call to minde ſo manie as for the preſent God ſhall bring to hand. And firſt, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth it ſelfe which we do reade chapter 11. verſe 17. <hi>He that is mercifull</hi> (ſaith the Spirit of God by the wiſe king) <hi>rewardeth his owne ſoule.</hi> That is to ſay, hee doth ſo grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and acceptable a dutie before God, when it is done in faith and obedience to God, that God of his rich
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12614:49"/> and free grace and mercie will ſurely reward it vnto him. and in the ſame chapter, verſes 24.25.26. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and is more increaſed. The liberall perſon ſhall haue plentie: and he that watereth, ſhall haue raine. Hee that withdraweth corne, the people will curſe him: but bleſſing ſhall be vpon the head of him that ſelleth corne.</hi> That is, of him that exerciſeth mercie in his priſing and ſelling of it, labouring in hard times to mitigate and being downe that extreme price which vnmercifull men ſtriue to bring it vnto. For as touching deare ſellers, ſuch of whom the common prouerb may be affirmed, that <hi>The more they heape,</hi> to wit, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <hi>the worſe they cheape</hi> to others: ſuch cannot in truth be euer right good and liberall dealers. They pull downe that with their left hand, which they ſeeme to build with their right: and ſo they fruſtrate their reward. Whereupon alſo it followeth in the ſame chapter of the holy Prouerbes: <hi>He that ſeeketh good things, getteth fauour: but he that ſeeketh euill it ſhall come vnto him.</hi> And in the 19. chap. verſ. 17. thus we reade: <hi>He that hath mercy vpon the poore lendeth vnto the Lord, and the Lord will recompence him that which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> And who can wiſh or deſire any more ſufficient ſurety or better pay-maiſter then he? Againe, chap. 21. verſ. 21. <hi>He that followeth after righteouſneſſe, and mercy:</hi> that is, he which is diligent in purſuing and taking hold of all good occaſions to practiſe the duties of righteouſneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>ſhall find life, righteouſneſſe and glorie.</hi> And againe, chap. 22.9. <hi>He that hath a good eye</hi> (that is to ſay, a mercifull eye, which will behold, and therewithall tender the neceſſities of the poore) <hi>ſhall be bleſſed: for he giueth of his bread to the poore.</hi> Likewiſe ch. 28.27. <hi>He that giueth vnto the poore ſhall not lacke.</hi> Thus much out of the holy Prouerbes.</p>
               <p>In the booke of the Preacher, ch. 11.1. &amp;c. <hi>Caſt thy bread vpon the waters</hi> (ſaith the ſame moſt wiſe king, a Prophet of God) <hi>for after many dayes thou ſhalt find it. Giue a portion to ſeuen and and alſo to eight. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the which wordes king Salomon like as the Apoſtle
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12614:49"/> Paul alſo hath done, as we ſaw before, compareth the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtian liberalitie and benficence, to a ſeed time, after the which followeth in due ſeaſon the increaſe of the harueſt. And in the ſame place he proſecuteth this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in verie excellent maner, thereby to prouoke to the diligent, ſpeedie, and conſtant following of this moſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandly plow. For <hi>He that obſerueth the wind</hi> (ſaith king Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) <hi>ſhal not ſowe, and he that regardeth the cloudes ſhall not reape:</hi> that is, he that will ſuffer himſelfe to be hindered from doing good by caſting of doubts, through vnbeleefe, or by any other ſtumbling blocke which the diuell ſhal caſt in his way, he ſhall miſſe the harueſt, becauſe he hath loſt the ſeed time. To the preuenting of which ſo great a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, king Salomon exhorteth as followeth: <hi>In the morning ſowe thy ſeed, and in the euening let not thy hand reſt: for thou knoweſt not which ſhall proſper this or that, or whether both ſhall be alike good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 18. chap. of Ezek. verſ. 7.8.9. and againe, verſes 16.17. The Lord doth verie earneſtly aſſure his people, that whether a man be the father of a wicked ſonne, or the ſon of a wicked father, ſuch is the equitie of his gratious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that if he himſelfe be not an oppreſſour, <hi>but hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the pledge to his debtor, hath ſpoiled none by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungrie, and hath couered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a garment. And hath not giuen forth vpon vſurie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath taken any increaſe, but hath withdrawne his hand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquitie, and hath executed true iudgement betweene man and man. And hath walked in my ſtatutes, and kept my iudgements to deale truly, he is iuſt, he ſhall ſurely liue, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, moreouer, and beſide all the teſtimonies he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto rehearſed, we haue a notable place in the 58. chap. of Iſaiah, verſes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The words are verie mightie to incourage and draw on euery good and faithful man, both Iew &amp; Gentile, to exerciſe the actions of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy. For after that the Lord hath, by his holy Prophet, rehearſed what he requireth to be done: namely,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12614:50"/> that <hi>euery heauie burthen be taken of, that the oppreſſed be let go free, and that euery yoke be broken. That bread be dealt to the hungrie that the poore which wander</hi> (he meaneth not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary beggers and wandering rogues, but ſuch as be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to leaue their place by ſome vrgent calamitie) <hi>be brought to mens houſes: When a man ſeeth the naked to couer him, and not to hide a mans ſelf from his owne fleſh.</hi> After this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall of the duties, and that in more preſſing maner then is here repeated: then followeth the gratious promiſe of God in theſe words: <hi>Then ſhall thy light breake forth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the morning, and thy health ſhall growe ſpeedily: thy righteouſneſſe ſhall go before thee, and the glorie of the Lord ſhall imbrace thee. Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord will anſwer: thou ſhalt cry, and he will ſay, Here am I: if thou take away from the middeſt of thee,</hi> (that is out of thy heart) <hi>the yoke</hi> (or the tying wherwith the heauy burthen is as it were faſtened to the backe) <hi>the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the finger and wicked ſpeaking</hi> (that is, euery inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and grieuance.) And then it followeth on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: <hi>If thou poure out thy ſoule to the hungrie, and refreſheſt the troubled ſoule: then</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall thy light ſpring out in the darkeneſſe, and thy darkeneſſe ſhall be as the noone day: and the Lord will guide thee continually, and he will ſatisfie thy ſoule in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou ſhalt be like a watered garden, and like a ſpring of water whoſe waters faile not. And they ſhall be of thee which ſhall build the old waſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: thou ſhalt raiſe vp foundations form many generations, and thou ſhalt be called the repairer of the breach, and a reſtorer of the pathes to dwell in.</hi> Now what man (though of his owne diſpoſition vnmercifull and illiberall, as all of vs are,) if he ſhall dulie conſider this manifold and bounteous promiſe of God, and if he ſhall gather but one ſparkle of faith, to beleeue that God is faithfull and his word true, can chuſe but he muſt bee affected, at the leaſt after the manner of king Agrippa, Act. chap. 26. verſ. 28. to confeſſe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt it perſwadeth him to become a mercifull and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man. To whom alſo willingly doe I ſay, as the Spirit
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12614:50"/> of God moued Paule to anſwer Agrippa, in that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about true faith: Would to God that not onely one, or a fewe almoſt, which reade this, and the reſt of the holie Scriptures, concerning this dutie of beneficence, might both almoſt, and altogether, become mercifull and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer this will not be: for the children of this world will ſtill and alwayes be like themſelues: the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man will be couetous ſtill, and he will increaſe in his vnmercifull courſes: yet I know aſſuredly, that the word and promiſe of God will effectually and ſtrongly preuaile with all that belong vnto him; not onely to prouoke them to obedience, but to fill their hearts alſo with exceeding comfort, in the performance of the duties thereof. For verily, as the holy Apoſtle truly teſtifieth Hebr. chap. 6. verſ. 10. <hi>God is not vnrighteous that he ſhould forget your worke and labour of loue, which yee haue ſhewed toward his name, in that ye haue miniſtred vnto the Saints, and yet do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, ſc.</hi> Wherefore worthily did Nehemiah, in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this goodneſſe and faithfulneſſe of God, embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den himſelfe to pray to God, not onely to remember that kindneſſe of his, which he had ſhewed toward the houſe and religion of God (as we haue ſeene before) but alſo that it would pleaſe him of his goodneſſe, to remember him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that he had done for the reliefe of the poore of his people. <hi>Remember me ô my God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in goodneſſe, according to all that I haue done for this people,</hi> Nehem. 5.19. In which chapter euen from the beginning to the end, is this part of Nehemiahs kindneſſe, mercie, and liberalitie fully deſcribed, for our ſingular inſtruction; ſpecially of thoſe that be in higher places, and haue greater power then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do more good.</p>
               <p>Finally, that we may conclude this point, let vs hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to that of the ſame Apoſtle, Heb. 13. from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the chapter. <hi>Let brotherly loue continue,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Be not forgetfull to logde ſtraungers: for thereby ſome haue
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12614:51"/> receiued Angels into their houſes vnnares.</hi> So indeed did A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham. So alſo did Lot: either of them being giuen to hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, as hath bene obſerued before. In which words, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Apoſtle hath giuen to vnderſtand that Loue is ſo tender and daintie a plant, that if it be not charily cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and maintained, it will weare away: he would giue vs further to vnderſtand, that though we are not in theſe dayes, to looke that Angels ſhould, in the ſhape of men, reſort to our houſes, as of ancient times they did to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patriarches and others: yet eaſily may ſuch as loue and practiſe hoſpitalitie, receiue into their houſes, ſuch ſeruants of God, as be more deare and precious in his ſight the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ware of, which kind of gueſſe ought alwayes to be very welcome to euery good man. And then alſo who knoweth how great bleſſing God will grant at their holy ſute &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, to thoſe good houſholders and families, where they are at any time, for the Lords ſake, kindly and louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intertained? Doubtleſſe, howſoeuer it be not alwayes ſo apparant, as heretofore it hath bene made ſometime by miraculous gratifications in the miniſterie of the Prophets, yet as touching ſpirituall recompence and bleſſing, the Goſpell hath bene and ſhall bee as beneficiall as euer the law, or times before the law haue bene, to the magnifying of the bountie of the moſt glorious grace of God reuealed and publiſhed therein, to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Hetherto therefore in the ſecond part of this chapter, of the promiſes of bleſſing vpon thoſe that ſhall exerciſe their liberalitie and beneficence, to the relieuing euen of the pooreſt of the people, ſpecially of ſuch as be greateſt in the obedience and patience of the faith of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now that henceforth we do confirme, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make plaine, that which is moſt true and certaine of it ſelfe, by ſome examples of thoſe, to whom the promiſe &amp; bleſſing of God hath bin in this reſpect manifeſtly perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vpon them. But I will vſe the former examples here, becauſe they which haue bene alleaged in the former part
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12614:51"/> of this chapter, are ſo many confirmations of this alſo: in ſo much as the ſame, who are dutifull maintainers and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods true religion and worſhip, they are alſo, as a ioint fruit of their zeale to God, louing and kind relieuers of the poore people of God: euen for that loue, which they beare vnto God. So that the bleſſing in either reſpect is the bleſſing of al through one and the ſame rich mercy &amp; large bountie of the Lord, who is a plentifull rewarder of euerie one, that truly ſeeketh &amp; wayteth vpon him.</p>
               <p>Now among thoſe ſo fewe examples, we will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to make mention of Iob, ſeeing he may well ſerue vs in ſteed of a thouſand authenticall examples. For as he was a man of ſingular goodneſſe and mercie (as was rehearſed among the manifold examples of beneficence recorded in the holy Scriptures) ſo was hee ſingularly bleſſed of God with all kinds of bleſſing, both ſpirituall, and alſo belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this life. It is true indeed, that it pleaſed God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and trie him for a certaine time, with verie great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, by loſſe of all his goods and cattell, by the hands of wicked men, yea and by a ſodaine deſtruction of all his children, as it were from heauen. All which the Lord did, to the end he might make Iob a notable patterne of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all poſteritie, and that the malice and crueltie of the diuell being poured out vpon ſo good and mercifull a man as Iob was, might be ſo much the more euidently diſcouered to the Church of God: as alſo for other notable ends, which are to be obſerued from that excellent ſtorie. Neuertheleſſe, after that Iob was tried, the Lord, to ſhewe that he did not forget his former goodneſſe; he renewed, yea increaſed, &amp; doubled all his former mercies vpon him. For he gaue him ſonnes and daughters as many as he had before; and his daughters the moſt beautifull women that could be found in the land. And of ſheepe, camels, oxen, and aſſes God gaue him twiſe ſo many thouſands of euery kind as he had before. For whereas he had before ſeuen thouſand ſheepe, now he had foureteene thouſand: then
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12614:52"/> three thouſand Camels, now ſixe thouſand: then fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yoke of oxen, now a thouſand: then but fiue hundred ſhe Aſſes, now a whole thouſand. So <hi>the Lord bleſſed the laſt dayes of Iob more then the firſt.</hi> And after this calamitie he liued an hundreth and fourtie yeares, and ſaw his ſonnes and his ſonnes ſonnes, euen foure generations: and left inheritance to all his children. Chapters firſt and laſt of that booke.</p>
               <p>Another excellent example we read of in the 22. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Propheſie of Ieremiah, verſe 15, &amp;c. where God ſaith of the good king Ioſiah, he vſing his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reproofe of his vnmercifull ſonne Shallum: <hi>Shalt thou reigne</hi> (ſaith the Lord by his Prophete) <hi>becauſe thou cloſeſt thy ſelfe in Cedar? Did not thy father eate and drinke and proſper, when he executed iudgement and iuſtice? When he iudged the cauſe of the afflicted and poore, he proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: was not this becauſe he knew me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> And ſo the holy Prouerbe teacheth, chapter 20.28. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euerie good king: <hi>Mercie and truth preſerue the King: for his throne is eſtabliſhed by mercie.</hi> And therefore, when the Lord ſpeaketh of the moſt bleſſed king, and of the moſt happie and ſtable kingdome that may be, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth it to be ſuch a kingdome, whereof the king ſhould be moſt mercifull to the poore and needy: and that hee ſhould preſerue their ſoules &amp;c. This kingdome moſt happie and flouriſhing, is onely the kingdome of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, Pſalme 72. verſes 12.13.14. Thus we haue two examples out of the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now one or two out of the new Teſtament, and ſo will we draw to an end of this chapter.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the 10. chapter of the Actes of the holy Apoſtles, the Euangeliſt Luke reporteth, that the Angell of the Lord, is from heauen, a witneſſe to Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, a religious and mercifull Captaine, that his prayer, and almes, were come vp into remembrance before God: and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12614:52"/> that therefore, it pleaſed God to grant him the deſire of his ſoule, that he might be more perfectly inſtructed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Chriſtian knowledge and faith of his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the Angell telleth Cornelius further, that God had for the ſame purpoſe, appointed Peter, who at that time lodged with one Simon a Tanner, dwelling by the ſea ſide in Ioppa; that he ſhould bee the Apoſtle and Miniſter of God to teach and inſtruct him: and therefore willeth him to ſend thither for Peter. All which came gratiouſly to paſſe, according vnto the meſſage of the holy Angell. And it was, doubtleſſe, a greater mercie and bleſſing to Cornelius, and his familie, and manie other of his kinſmen and ſpeciall friendes, then if hee could by any couetous pinching and ſparing, haue increaſed his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riches by manie thouſandes: yea greater, then if by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie warlike valour and outward force, hee could, with with a few men, haue conquered the whole world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Finallie, that God might leaue to all poſteritie a moſt memorable demonſtration, howe well pleaſing to his Maieſtie the ſacrifice of beneficence and mercie is; it hath pleaſed him, that by the miniſterie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Peter (euen now mentioned) one Dorcas a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian woman of ſingular mercie and liberalitie to poore Saintes, ſhould, at the lamentation of manie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, both widdowes and other, who mourned for the loſſe of her, bee miraculouſly raiſed vp from death to life, Act. chap. 9. verſe 36. &amp;c. God thereby giuing all to vnderſtand, both howe pretious his poore beleeuers and Chriſtians are vnto him, in that rather then they ſhould be foſterleſſe, he will raiſe mercifull men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of the graue: and alſo how deare they are vnto him, who relieue ſuch as hee maketh ſo ſpeciall account of. For they are the heires of the reſurrection of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, to euerlaſting life and happineſſe in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:12614:53"/>
               <p>Thus then (euen by a fewe examples, as by two or three witneſſes, which, eſpecially on the Lords behalfe, may ſuffice for the eſtabliſhing of any truth) it may be euident vnto vs, as the cauſe by the effect, that the promiſes of God made to aſſure all mercifull men and women of his great fauour and bleſſing are not giuen forth in vaine. So that as it is ſayd of the vpright and righteous man, Pſalme 37. verſe 37. <hi>Marke the vpright man and behold the iuſt: for the end of that man is peace:</hi> we may boldly affirme the ſame of the mercifull man. For the vpright and iuſt man, and the right mercifull man is all one, as is euident in the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the ſame Pſalme.</p>
               <p>God, no doubt, who moued king Dauid, to remember to ſhewe kindenes to the ſonne of Ionathan, for that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which Ionathan had in former times ſhewed vnto him. For therefore did King Dauid allowe Mephiboſheth the ſonne of Ionathan, alwayes to eate breade at his owne table, as if he had bene one of the kinges owne ſonnes, 2. Sam. ch. 9. The ſame God, who worketh the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vſuallie in the heartes of all his good ſeruantes, as we ſhall haue further occaſion to declare in the ſecond part of this Treatiſe: yea that God who oftentimes turneth the heartes euen of verie wicked and cruell men, to ſhewe kindenes to his children, as the Egyptians to the Iſraelites, and Eſau to Iaakob, &amp;c. He himſelfe, I ſay, will much leſſe forget them that be kinde to anie of his, for that loue which they beare vnto him. For as God is infinitelie more gratious, mercifull, and bounteous then man can bee: ſo hath he, by infinite degrees, a more perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, to requite all kindeneſſes, then they can poſſibly haue. And as hee hath a moſt perfect remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, infinitelie aboue man, ſo alſo is hee moſt able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue man to recompence all kindeneſſe, in that hee is the Almightie; and likewiſe moſt willing aboue man, ſeeing hee is the moſt mercifull aboue all, as was ſaid euen now: That God is thus moſt willing we reade 2. Cor. ch.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12614:53"/> 9.10. <hi>He that findeth ſeed to the ſower</hi> (ſaith S. Paul) <hi>wil miniſter likewiſe bread for food &amp; multiply your ſeed &amp; increſe the fruits of your beneuolence. That on all parts ye may be made rich to all liberalitie, &amp;c.</hi> That God is likewiſe moſt able, look back to the 8. verſe of the ſame chap. <hi>God is able</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>to make all grace to abound</hi> toward euery free-hearted and chearefull giuer: for of ſuch he there writeth. And that God is not forgetfull, we haue ſeene before, from the 10. verſe of the 6. chap. of the epiſtle to the Hebrewes. Where it is worthy to be diligently noted of vs, that God accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it a part of his righteouſneſſe, to haue the worke and labour of the loue of his good beneficiall ſeruants in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remembrance. <hi>For God is not vnrighteous</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>that he ſhould forget, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore we may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as ſure &amp; certaine that God wil not forget vs, as we are ſure that he neither is, nor can be in any thing vniuſt. Let vs not therefore, as the ſame Apoſtle exhorteth, chap. 10.35. caſt away our confidence in this behalfe, which vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly hath great recompence of reward. Though man ſhould forget thoſe that haue deſerued well of them. Yea, though (as it doth not ſeldom fall out) that man requiteth good with euill: as Pſal. 38.20. <hi>They that reward euill for good</hi> (as the holie Prophet complaineth) <hi>are mine aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, becauſe I follow goodneſſe.</hi> Yet God will at no hand deale ſo: but though we can claime nothing by deſert from him, but we are to account our ſelues vnprofitable ſeruants, as touching any benefite which we yeelde vnto him: yet through his mercie, as it is ſayd of the prayers of his good ſeruants, ſo may it be affirmed of all their good and kinde dealings, that they ſhall be turned vpon their own boſoms, according to that we reade, Pſal. 35. verſ. 12.13.14.</p>
               <p>O therefore, how I beſeech you, ſhould not the earneſt conſideration of theſe things mightily preuayle to moue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, in whom there is any ſparkle of grace, to minde this practiſe of Chriſtian beneficence and mercie toward the poore of Gods people, according to euery mans abilty!
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12614:54"/> And euen for the ſame cauſe alſo, as hath bene before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to ſeparate and lay aſide a portion before hand of that bleſſing which God giueth. That ſo we may haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a purſe or coffer to this ſpirituall vſe and ſeruice of the Lord, as well repleniſhed as may be. And to this ſo bleſſed an end, that all which haue aboundance ſhould cut off, as much as may be, all ſuperfluous and vaine expences in apparell, in diet, in building, in plate, in houſhold ſtuffe, and in euerie coſtly and curious ornament whatſoeuer is to any in his place and calling, aboue that which is ſober and meete. For by this wiſe, prouident, and ſober courſe, not onely the richer, but alſo ſuch as be of leſſe wealth, ſhall find both a more richer treaſurie to defray all char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges this way, and alſo a more readie heart and hand, to extende their helpe toward all good reliefe. And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will come to paſſe, that though we be ouercome to giue, yet will it be yeelded ſo vngainely from vs, as it were the ſmall ſparkle out of the hard flint, or as ſawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt grated out of the belly of the hard oake, or, to ſpeake the faireſt of it, it will be but as a thinne and ſhort eare of corne, out of a verie barren and vnfruitfull ſoyle. So that looſing all grace in the giuing, it doth make the gift it ſelfe voyde of all bleſſing, like vnto the light and waſte ſeede, which being ſowne, taketh no roote in the ground.</p>
               <p>Verily, if we could earneſtly and ingeniouſly conſider with our ſelues, and lay together all the reaſons which are to be weighed in this argument: as namely, for a taſte, that in ſo doing, wee perfourme the dutie of good and faithfull Stewards to God, in the right diſpoſing of thoſe his creatures, which hee hath betruſted vs withall: that thereby we preuent much murmuring and ſin, and much vniuſt dealing by pilferie and deceit, yea infinite dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſnares and temptations, whereby the diuell ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth weake Chriſtians, as may eaſily appeare vnto vs by the prayer of holy Agur, Prou. 30. chap. 7.8.9. <hi>Giue mee

And yet further, that we defeat the moth, the canker, and the thiefe, and ſtore vp our treaſure in heauen, as our Sauior Chriſt teacheth vs. In like manner, that we are vnder the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the prayers of the poore, which is as a princely protection, ſealed vnto vs, as it were, with the broad ſeale of the kingdome of heauen, Iob. chap. 29.13. Finally, that we are therein bleſſed of God himſelfe with all kind of bleſſings in this life; and ſhall more comfortably leaue this world, whenſoeuer God ſhall call vs out of it.

               <p>And firſt, let vs conſider how God hath puniſhed the neglect of furthering his worſhip. Whereunto well ſerueth that which we reade, Hagg. chap. 1. verſe. 2. &amp;c. in theſe words: <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſtes, ſaying, This people ſay, the time is not yet come, that the Lords houſe ſhould be builded. Then came the word of the Lord, by the miniſterie of the Prophet Haggai, ſaying, Is it time for your ſelues to dwell in your ſieled houſes, and this houſe he waſte? Now therefore, thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, Conſider your owne hearts. Ye haue ſowne much, and bring in little: ye eate, but ye haue not enough: yee drinke, but ye are not filled: you clothe your ſelues, but ye be not warme: and he that earneth wages, putteth the wages into a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bag. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, Conſider your owne wayes in your hearts. Go ye vp to the mountaine and bring wood, and build this houſe, and I will be fauourable in it, and I will be glorified in it, ſaith the Lord. Ye looked for much, but loe, it came to little: and vvhen yee brought it home, I did blowe vpon it. And why, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes? Becauſe of mine houſe that is waſte, and yee runne euerie man to his owne houſe. Therefore the heauen ouer ye ſtayed it ſelfe from dewe, and the earth ſtayed her fruite. And I called for a drought vpon the land, and vpon the mountaines, and vpon the corne, and vpon the wine, and vpon the oyle, euen vpon all that the ground bringeth forth: both vpon men and vpon cattell, and vpon all the labour of the hands.</hi> And againe, chap. 2. verſe 16. &amp;c. <hi>And nowe I pray ye conſider in your mindes: from this day and before, euen before a ſtone was layd vpon a ſtone, in the Temple of the Lord: Before theſe things were,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12614:56"/> when one came to a heape of twentie meaſures, there were but tenne: when one came to the wine preſſe, to drawe out fiftie meaſures out of the preſſe, there were but twentie. I ſmote ye with blaſting, and with mildewe, and with haile, in all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of your hands, yet ye turned not to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Worthy therefore in this reſpect is that admonition of the heathen king Artaſhaſht to be well obſerued (and wel had it bene for the Iewes if they had attended to it) who after that he had, together with his princely and bountifull gifts for the furtherance of the worſhip of God, giuen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that whatſoeuer the God of heauen had commanded, ſhould be done ſpeedily: he alleageth the reaſon for it, as we read Ezra 7.23. <hi>For why</hi> (ſaith the king) <hi>ſhould God be wroth againſt the realme of the King and his children?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Lord by his Prophet Malachie dealeth yet more roundly &amp; ſeuerely, according to the greater neglect, yea, contempt of his holy worſhip, in the time that he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied. <hi>Will a man ſpoyle his gods?</hi> (ſaith the Lord by his holy Prophete) <hi>yet ye haue ſpoyled me: but ye ſay, wherein haue we ſpoyled thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are curſed with a curſe, for ye haue ſpoyled me, this whole nation.</hi> And euen therefore, as we may vnderſtand by that which followeth: <hi>The deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath deſtroyed the fruit of their ground, and their vine was barren in the field.</hi> chap. 3.8.9.11.</p>
               <p>But what is this to vs Chriſtians, will ſome perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſay? Verily the ſame in effect and ſubſtance which it was vnto the Iewes: in ſo much as the Lord is as zealous for his worſhip to this day, as euer he was in former times: and the liuely ſtones alſo of that ſpirituall Temple, whereof the ſonne of God, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the chiefe corner ſtone, they are euery way as greatly regarded of him, yea rather much more preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, then were the dead and cold ſtones, or whole building of the Temple of Ieruſalem. And therefore, as well in regarde of his ſpirituall worſhippe, as of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12614:57"/> pooreſt of thoſe that do trulie worſhip him; we are iuſtly to looke for the like, if not greater plagues and puniſhments then the Iewes ſuſtained, if wee ſhall in like maner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and neglect the ſame.</p>
               <p>And euen already no doubt, becauſe of our great errors and faylings either way, it is come to paſſe, that as in the dayes of king Dauid in Iſrael, ſo in the reigne of our owne Queene God hath of late viſited England, though in great mercy, with a dearth, not onely of three yeares, but almoſt of twiſe three together. And muſt we not needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it very equall, that as we haue bene very vnfruitfull to God in his ſeruice and worſhip, and exceeding ſlacke in the aduancement of it; as alſo too ſcant and niggardly, yea rather hard and heauie againſt our poore brethren, lo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares together: that therefore our fieldes, and all other our indeuours and labours ſhould be barren and vnfruitfull vnto vs? Verily, we may iuſtly acknowledge, that <hi>it is the Lords mercie only that we haue not bene altogether conſumed, euen becauſe his compaſſions faile not.</hi> Lament. 3.22.</p>
               <p>Thus we may perceiue, as in a more generall view, how God puniſheth the profane and illiberall neglect of the furtherance and aduancement of his true religion and therewithall alſo, the neglect of relieuing the poore of his people. And there is no doubt, but he will more ſeuerely puniſh this kind of people, then with temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here in this world, if they repent not. For, <hi>The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall turne into hell, and all nations that forget God,</hi> Pſalme 9.17. And Prou. 20.25. <hi>It is deſtruction for a man to deuour that which is ſanctified, and after the vowes to inquire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, it is worthie to be obſerued, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the ceremony of the dedicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery mans whole increaſe of outward bleſſings, by offering vp a firſt fruites vnto God, commanded in the ceremoniall law of Moſes be now ceaſed: yet ſeeing the very morall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which is perpetuall, requireth exactly, that Gods true religion and worſhip be maintained and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12614:57"/> &amp; alſo, that the poore of his people be liberally relieued by the contributions of the richer ſort of his ſeruants, as hath bene ſufficiently declared before: it may truly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that no man can enioy his goods &amp; poſſeſſions, what ſoeuer he hath, as ſanctified vnto him, with approbation &amp; bleſſing from God, vnles he do of zeale to Gods glory, and loue to the brethren, beſtow a iuſt and meete portion this way. For as the Lord doth in his owne right iuſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all to be entirely his, as Pſal. 24 1. <hi>The earth is the Lord, and all that is therein, the world and they that dwell ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> and againe Pſalme 50.10.11.12. and 1. Chron. 29.11.12. <hi>All that is in heauen and earth is the Lords. Both riches &amp; honor come of him.</hi> Likewiſe Hag. 2.9. <hi>Siluer is mine &amp; gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> So he hath, as an homage to him ſelf from the rich, intereſſed the poore, as in his ſteed, to the liberal almes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribution of the rich mens goods. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the charge is ſtreightly giuen, Pro. 3.27. that none <hi>withhold his goodneſſe,</hi> or beneficence, <hi>from the owners ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> that is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as ſtand in preſent need therof. The like charge is giuen in many other places of the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to ſee in ſome orderly courſe, the more particular and diſtinct puniſhments of all prophane, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberall, couetous, and mercileſſe people.</p>
               <p>The manifold puniſhments of them are comprehended vnder theſe two heads: firſt, thoſe which belong to this life: ſecondly, that which appertaineth to the world to come: which one containeth all, and being eternall, is as the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp and fulneſſe of all the temporall.</p>
               <p>Of the former ſort are theſe which follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, the profane, illiberall, couetous, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe man neither hath, neither poſſibly can haue in his ſoule any comfort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God of all his riches, how great abundance ſoeuer he doth enioy. The which puniſhment, conſiſting in the priuation or with-holding of comfort and bleſſing; king Salomon, as a holy Preacher and Prophete of God in the beginning of the ſixth chap. of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12614:58"/> obſerue,<note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of not giuing to the poore.</note> among many other the great vanities of this vaine and ſinfull world: of the which alſo he ſaith, that it is much among men. <hi>There is an euill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which I ſawe vnder the ſunne, and it is much among men. A man to whom God hath giuen riches, and pleaſure, and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that it deſireth, but God giueth him not power to eate thereof, but a ſtrange man ſhall eate it vp: this is vanitie and this is an euill ſickeneſſe.</hi> And againe, chap. 5. verſe 9. <hi>He that loueth ſiluer, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſiluer, and hee that loueth riches, ſhall bee vvithout the fruite thereof: this alſo</hi> (ſaith the holie Preacher,) <hi>is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how, I pray you, ſhould prophane and couetous men haue any true and ſound comfort from the hand and Spirit of God concerning any thing which they haue; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God eſteemeth them as vſurpers, and not right owners of them? They may well enough haue a ciuill title allowable among men, according to the receiued courſe and determination of humane lawes and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions: but they cannot hold them as a portion ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them by the Lord, vntill they ſhall thankefully acknowledge them to be his free gift; and accordingly ſhall dedicate and apply them to ſuch holy vſes as he hath by his ſacred word appointed them vnto. This then is the firſt puniſhment, euen the want of true comfort and bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God doth manie times, for this their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, take away their riches, and caſteth miſerable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie vpon them. For ſo the holy Prouerb teacheth, chap. 11.24. <hi>He that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely commeth to pouertie.</hi> This briefly is a ſecond puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, God refuſeth to ſuccour the vnmercifull, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſtand in need, yea he leaueth them in their miſerie, when they call and crie to him in their diſtreſſe, becauſe they refuſed to helpe and ſuccour ſuch of their poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as craued helpe of them. So we reade Prou. 13.21.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12614:58"/> 
                  <hi>He that ſtoppeth his eare at the crying of the poore, he ſhall alſo crie and not be heard.</hi> Likewiſe Zech. chap. 7. verſe 8. &amp;c. <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying: Execute true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhewe mercie and compaſſion euerie man to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And oppreſſe not the widdowe, nor the fatherleſſe, nor the ſtranger, nor the poore, and let none of you imagine euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his brother in your heart. But they refuſed to hearken,</hi> (ſaith the holie Prophet) <hi>and pulled away the ſhoulder, &amp; ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their eares, that they ſhould not heare. Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould heare the law, and the words which the Lord of Hoſts ſent in his Spirit, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the former Prophets:</hi> (wherein marke by the way, the mightie increaſe, and obdurate obſtinacie which ſinne quickely groweth vnto, where it is not reſiſted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) <hi>therefore</hi> (as it followeth in the text) <hi>there came a great wrath from the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And againe, as it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth immediately. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>it is come to paſſe, that as he cried, and they would not heare, ſo they cried, and I would not heare, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. But I ſcattered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among all the nations whom they knew not: thus the land was deſolate after them, that no man paſſed through, nor returned: for they layd the pleaſant land waſte.</hi> The Prophete Micah alſo, the third chap. of his Propheſie, verſes 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Heare I pray you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ô heades of Iaakob, and ye Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the houſe of Iſraell: Should not ye know iudgement? But they hate the good and loue the euill: they plucke off their skinnes from them, and their fleſh from their bones. And they eate alſo the fleſh of my people, and flay off their skinnes from them, and they breake their bones, and choppe them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as for the pot, and as fleſh within the chaldron.</hi> Thus heinous is the ſinne of vnmercifulneſſe and crueltie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſo dolefull a deſcription, ſpecially, it it bee found in the bloudy hand of the Prince, or in anie of chiefe place and power vnder him, who ſhould bee moſt tender foſter-fathers ouer the people of God, and chiefly ouer the poore of the flocke. For neglect whereof
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:12614:59"/> the puniſhment followeth: <hi>Then ſhall they crie vnto the Lord</hi> (to wit, in their miſerie) <hi>but he will not heare them: he will euen hide his face from them at that time,</hi>

For in remembrance of that their crueltie, euen nowe manie yeares after it was committed, <hi>They ſay one of them to another</hi> (as we reade Gen. 42.21.) <hi>We haue verily ſinned againſt our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoule, when he beſought vs and we would not heare him: therefore is this trouble come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs.</hi> And moreouer Ruben ſaid, <hi>Lo his bloud is now required.</hi> And verily, it cannot be denied, but that it was Gods exceeding great mercie, that his heauy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance had not long before that, not only terrified them, but euen fallen vpon them and deſtroyed them, as it did the poſteritie of Eſau for the like ſinne, as we reade in the Propheſie of Obadiah. But not onely doth the Lord pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh crueltie, by the withdrawing of his aſſiſtance and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but alſo the neglect of ſhewing mercie, and of ſtaying the bloudy courſe of other mens crueltie, according to that good occaſion and lawfull power, which God hath put into the hand of any of his ſeruants: according to that in 24. chap. of the Prouerbes, verſes 10. 11. 12. <hi>If thou be faint</hi> (or deale remiſſely, ſaith the Lord by king Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) that is, if thou in helping and ſuccouring others, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſo, as if thou caredſt not greatly whether the diſtreſſed ſhould haue any helpe from thee, or no: <hi>in the day of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity thy ſtrength ſhall be ſmall.</hi> Whereupon in the next words the Spirit of God doth mightily ſtirre vp and exhort euerie one to a more ſerious indeuour, and that with a mind ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly bent to ſuccour indeed. <hi>Deliuer them</hi> (ſaith the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God) <hi>that are drawne to death: and wilt thou not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue

In this reſpect therefore, are the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell commended, as we read, 1. Sam. 14.45. becauſe they reskued and deliuered Ionathan againſt the raſh oth and decree of Saule. <hi>Shall Ionathan die</hi> (ſay they) <hi>who hath ſo mightily deliuered Iſrael? God forbid. As the Lord liueth, there ſhal not one hair of his head fal to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for he hath wrought with God. So the people deliuered Ionathan that he died not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord doth not ſeldome ſhorten the dayes of couetous vnmercifull and cruell men; and ſo taketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their riches, which they held, as it were, by vniuſt impriſonment, yea in cloſe priſon ſo long as they liued: or if they continue long in their abuſiue poſſeſſion of their wealth, it turneth to their greater puniſhment and plague in the end. But for the moſt part God ſhorteneth the dayes of thoſe, which make haſt, till they come to a certaine ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this ſinne: as Pſalm. 55.23. <hi>Bloudy and deceitfull men ſhall not liue half their dayes.</hi> And Pſal. 140.11.12. <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters ſhall not be eſtabliſhed vpon earth: euill ſhall hunt the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell man to deſtruction. I know</hi> (ſaith the holy Pſalmiſt) <hi>that the Lord will auenge the afflicted, and iudge the poore.</hi> Neither is the holy Prouerbe ſet downe in vaine, that the curſe of the people ſhall fall vpon him that withdraweth corne, ch. 11.26. <hi>He that hideth his eyes,</hi> (to wit from the poore) <hi>ſhall haue many curſes.</hi> For God himſelfe ſaith, that he will take knowledge of thoſe curſes, which are thus violently extorted: and that he will puniſh thoſe, who giue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12614:60"/> of them: according to that which we read Exod. 22. verſes 22.23.24. Ye ſhall not trouble any widdowe nor fatherleſſe childe. If thou vexe or trouble ſuch (ſaith the Lord) and ſo he call and crie vnto me, I will ſurely heare his crie. Then ſhall my wrath be kindled, and I wil kill you with the ſword, and your wiues ſhall be widdowes, &amp; your children fatherleſſe.</p>
               <p>And ô how heauie and fearefull an imprecation is that which the holy Ghoſt himſelfe (though he be moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and mercifull) hath iuſtly indited againſt ſuch, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare moſt manifeſtly, that there is no mercie with God for them: yea, and that they make their poſteritie alſo liable to the ſame curſe, as we read, Pſalme 109.6. &amp;c. where the holy Prophet, guided by the holy Ghoſt, prayeth againſt them in this maner: <hi>Set thou the wicked ouer him, &amp;c. Let his dayes be few, and let another take his charge. Let his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be fatherleſſe, and his wife a widdowe. Let his children be vagabonds and beg, and let them ſeeke bread,</hi> or their beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers allowance, <hi>comming out of their places deſtroyed. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath, and let ſtrangers ſpoyle his labour. Let there be none to extend mercy vnto him: neither let there be any to ſhew mercie on his fatherleſſe children. Let his poſterity be deſtroyed, and in the generation following let their name be put out, &amp;c.</hi> But why is all this? It followeth. <hi>Becauſe he remembred not to ſhew mercy, but perſecuted the afflicted &amp; poore man, and the ſorrowfull hearted to ſlay him. And</hi> becauſe <hi>he wiſhed the curſe to come vnto him:</hi> that is, to the poore and afflicted, <hi>&amp;c. Let it</hi> (therefore) <hi>be vnto himſelfe as a garment to clothe him, and for a girdle wherewith he ſhall alwayes girde himſelfe. &amp;c.</hi> There is more in the Pſalme tending this way: not of any bitter or vncharitable affection, but as a pure interpretation of the iuſtice of God againſt this ſin. But vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it only to be penned againſt ſuch as are obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hardened and ſetled in it, as it were in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: they malicing the poore ſeruants of God, euen the rather becauſe they are his ſeruants. But if any doe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12614:60"/> thinke the imprecation ouer harſh, (which none can doe without greate ſinne againſt God,) let ſuch rather learne from the horrour of the curſe, ſo to conſider the haynouſneſſe of the ſinne, that they may bee as carefull to auoyd it, both for their owne ſake, and alſo for the ſake of their poſteritie, as they would be loth to ſuſtaine the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The like imprecation to the former, doth Nehemiah, that good, mercifull, and bounteous noble man, guided by the ſame holy ſpirit of God, vſe, in zeale againſt the like obſtinacie of the ſame ſinne of vnmercifulneſſe: Nehe. 5.13. where he thus ſpeaketh: <hi>I ſhooke my lap</hi> (ſaith he) to wit, after that he had obteined of the richer ſort, who had dealt cruellie before, that they promiſed thenceforth to deale mercifully toward their poore brethren: <hi>and I ſaid, So let God ſhake out euery man that will not perfourme this promiſe, from his houſe and from his labour:</hi> that is, that being thruſt out of houſe and home, he may alſo be vnproſperous in all his affaires: <hi>euen thus</hi> (ſaith Nehemiah) <hi>let him be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out and emptied. And all the Congregation ſaid Amen, and praiſed the Lord.</hi> Yea, and the richer ſort fearing the impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which was thus denounced in the name of God, &amp; conſented vnto of all, they performe that which they had promiſed. A bleſſed and ſweete fruite of a heauie and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curſe, though vttered without all bitterneſſe in the moſt pure and temperate zeale of Gods holy Spirit, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued before.</p>
               <p>And now further, for our preſent purpoſe, to ſhew that the iudgement of God watcheth ouer vnmercifull men for euill and not for good; we haue ready at hand the example of Nabal that churle, whom God cut off, as an vnprofitable branch, ſhortly after he had dealt ſo like himſelfe, that is, like a profane and ſottiſh miſer, againſt Dauid the good ſeruant of the Lord: in that he not onelie denied to ſend him anie reliefe, but alſo verie contemptuouſly reproched and reuiled him. For about tenne daies after he had dealt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12614:61"/> thus, the Lord ſmote Nabal that he dyed. 1. Sam. 25.9. &amp;c. 38. wherefore, when Dauid heard that Nabal was dead, he ſayd, as one giuing glorie to God, in his righteous iudgment; Bleſſed be the Lord who hath iudged the cauſe of my rebuke, of the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his ſeruant from euil: for the Lord hath recompenced the wickednes of Nabal vpon his owne head.</p>
               <p>And in like manner, Ier. 22.13. &amp;c. God doth by his Prophet threaten Shallum a wicked ſonne of the good king Ioſiah, altogether degenerating from his fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and giuing himſelfe to pleaſure, without all regard of relieuing the oppreſſed: yea executing crueltie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of wicked men: <hi>Wo</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>to him that buildeth his houſe by vnrighteouſnes, and his chambers without equitie: hee vſeth his neighbour without wages, and giueth not him for his worke. Hee ſaith, I will build me a wide houſe with large chambers: ſo he will make himſelfe large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and ſieling with Cedar, and paint them with vermelion. Shalt thou reigne,</hi> (ſaith the Lord to Shallum) <hi>becauſe thou cloſeſt thy ſelfe in Cedar? &amp;c.</hi> No, but as it followeth: <hi>Thine eyes are onelie for thy couetouſneſſe, and for to ſheade inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, and for oppreſſion, and for deſtruction, euen to doo this. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, againſt Iehoiakim the ſonne of Ioſiah king of Iudah</hi> (who before was called by an other name, Shallum. <hi>They ſhall not lament him, ſaying, Alas, my brother, or, Alas my ſiſter: neither ſhall they mourne for him, ſaying, Alas Lord, or Alas for his glorie. He ſhall be buried as an Aſſe is buried, euen drawne and caſt forth without the gates Ieruſalem.</hi> This iudgement fell vpon him in Babel.</p>
               <p>The like diſhonour euen for the like cauſe befell the King of Babel himſelfe, namelie, Belſhazzar, Dan. ch. 5. according to the propheſie of Iſaiah, againſt that whole cruell and bloudie monarchie: ch. 14. verſes 3.4.5.6. <hi>In that day</hi> (ſaith the Prophete to the faithfull among the Iewes) <hi>when the Lord ſhall giue thee reſt from thy ſorrowe, and from thy feare, and from the ſore bondage wherein thou

The Lord hath broken the rod of the wicked, &amp;c.</hi> And then verſe 18. &amp;c. <hi>All the kings of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they all ſleepe in glorie, euery one in his owne houſe: But thou art caſt out of thy graue, like an abominable branch: like the rayment of thoſe that are ſlaine and thruſt through with a ſword, which go downe to the ſtones of the pit, as a cark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thine owne houſe by deſtroying many people, and thou haſt ſinned againſt thine own ſoule. For the ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beame</hi> (or

Behold, is it not of the Lord of Hoſtes that the people</hi> (that, is ſuch a wicked people) <hi>ſhall labour for fire, and that the nations ſhould wearie themſelues for meere vanitie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe, according to the threatening contained in theſe Propheſies, againſt the Kinges of Babel, and their Monarchie; the Lord hath made them that lifted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vp in the greateſt height of pride and of couetous and mercileſſe dealing, the moſt euident ſpectacles to all the world, of his glorious iudgement executed vpon them for the ſame. For all this was confirmed in that ouerthrowe which God gaue them once for euer by the Medes and Perſians, whom hee raiſed vp and ſent in battell againſt them. So then, let this kinde of mercileſſe and cruell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be neuer ſo ſtronglie rooted, let them bee growne vp neuer ſo high, let them be maintained and vpheld neuer ſo ſtronglie, euen with the power of a mightie monarchie: yet ſhall neither they, nor their vpholders, be able to eſcape the puniſhing hand of God. Nay rather, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by theſe examples, that as the ſinne is in higher degree, and the offenders more mightie, ſo the almightie God, who iudgeth without reſpect of perſons, increaſeth his wrath, and ſtretcheth out his hand more ſtronglie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>And here, I pray you, let vs not altogether forget (that among the other ſinnes for the which Sodom &amp; Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha with ſome other cities about them, were deſtroyed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen by fire) this was not the leaſt, that there was among them no regard to ſtrengthen the poore and needy, Ezek. 16.49. And was not cruelty one ſpeciall ſin for the which the whole world was drowned. Gen. 6.13. So that we may iuſtly ſay here, as the Prophet Dauid ſaith of proud &amp; cruel perſons, Pſal. 73.19.20. <hi>O how ſuddenly are they deſtroyed, periſhed and horrible conſumed, As a dreame whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one awaketh!</hi> wherefore from theſe examples let all, both high and lowe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12614:62"/> kingdoms &amp; cities, and al people, learne for euer ſo to feare before God, that we be not found leſſe or more in theſe grieuous ſins, leſt we alſo taſte of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon euill, which K. Salomon noteth to be in the world,<note place="margin">Riches wel got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp; wel vſed, are as Manna from heauen: otherwiſe they are as the Quailes which God ſent in his anger to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe that eat them. Calu. 2. Cor. 8.15.</note> that <hi>Riches be reſerued to the owners thereof for their euill:</hi> &amp; that no doubt becauſe they be not careful to vſe them well. Eccle. 5.12. And thus we ſee the fourth kind of puniſhment vpon illiberall &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful men, ſpecially if they grow to any ripeneſſe in this ſinne.</p>
               <p>In the Church of God there is a fift puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which we may account the greateſt here on earth, and the verie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of that which is greateſt of all in the world to come: namely, that the couetous and vnmercifull man, though it may be, he liueth vnder the profeſſion of the true religion of God, among his people, yet in the eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord, who iudgeth righteous iudgement, he is no better then a rotten &amp; dead branch, cut off &amp; excommunicate from the holy communion of Chriſt and his Church. Neither doth the Lord like, that ſuch as are faithfull Chriſtians indeede, ſhuld haue any familiarity with ſuch as withdraw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from holy contributions, &amp; the liberall practiſe of mercy &amp; goodnes, among the reſt of the people of God. So ſaith the Apoſtle Paul. 1. Cor. 5.11. <hi>If any that is called a brother be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous perſon, &amp;c. with ſuch one eat not.</hi> And 1. Tim. 6.5. <hi>From ſuch as thinke that gaine is godlineſſe</hi> (that is, from ſuch as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pofeſſion of religion, do diſcouer themſelues to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together worldly and couetouſly minded) <hi>ſeparate thy ſelfe.</hi> Of theſe the Apoſtle greatly complaineth. Heb. 10.25. and ſaith, that they withdraw themſelues to perdition, verſ. 39.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, hauing rehearſed the manifold puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes belonging to profane, couetous and vnmercifull people, here in this world; and in the laſt place hauing found that it is the next way to euerlaſting deſtruction: it is time, that we doo nowe conſider of this which is the greateſt puniſhement of all; and as was ſayd, the ſealing vp and fulneſſe of all the reſt, for euer and euer. For what are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12614:63"/> all the puniſhmentes of this life laid together, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that moſt wofull damnation and torment, which (this life once ended) ſhall for euer be caſt vpon couetous &amp; mercileſſe men: where the gnawing worme of a guiltie and wounded conſcience neuer dyeth, and where the moſt hote furnace of Gods wrath continually burneth vpon them. What is the want of all true comfort in the thinges of this life, which a couetous merciles man inioyeth here, to the fulneſſe of all ſorrowe and dolour there? What is the impoueriſhing of a couetous rich man, which (as hath beene ſhewed) is ſometimes his lot and ſhare here in this world? What is, this I ſay, to his moſt certaine and extreme deſolation in the pit of Hell? What is the firſt death, the loſſe of this life, and ſhortening of the dayes thereof, in compariſon of the loſſe of euerlaſting life, and the glorious happineſſe therof? Yea rather, in compariſon of the more ſpeedie and quicke paſſage to the ſecond death, and the moſt miſerable torment thereof. What is the temporarie ſeparation from the ſocietie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full here, to that ſeparation which is <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n-atha,</hi> euen till the Lord ſhall come to giue the laſt ſentence of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for euer and euer: which ſhall not onelie be, to the ſhutting of them out from a l hope of communion with the Saints and holy Angels of God; but alſo to the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of them downe to the hiddeous and horrible fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the diuell and all his curſed Angels, and to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fellowſhip of all filthy idolaters, blaſphemers, traitors, murtherers, adulterers, and all kind of wicked ones, in the moſt vncomfortable dungeon of vtter darkeneſſe. Finally, what were the winning and enioying of the riches of the whole world, accompanied with all the pleaſures thereof, and that without any intermixed ſorrowes, though it were for a thouſand yeares long: what is this, or the beſt that may be imagined, to counteruaile the leaſt part of that worſt, which God hath prepared for this bad ſort of men world without end?</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:12614:63"/>
               <p>Now, that the end of the profane couetous and vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful man ſhall be ſuch as hath bene deſcribed, it appeareth euidently by ſundry expreſſe teſtimonies of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: as 1. Cor 6.10. <hi>No couetous man ſhall inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> In the which place the couetous man is recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, wantons, buggerers, and ſuch like abominable perſons. And againe, Epheſ. 5.5. <hi>This ye know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Epheſus) <hi>that no whoremonger, neither vncleane perſon, nor couetous perſon, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Chriſt and of God.</hi> And ſeeing they haue no inheritance there, what remaineth but that they muſt haue their portion in hell. For there are no other places for the ſoules of men after this life ended, neither ſhall be for their brdies and ſoules after the reſurrection from the dead, but either heauen or hell. Wherefore euen in the next verſe the ſame Apoſtle addeth this earneſt admonition and godly caueat againſt all contrarie flattering of our ſelues, or vaine ſuggeſtion of others: <hi>Let no man deceiue ye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with vaine words</hi> (he calling ſuch vaine wordes, whereby ſinne and the extreme danger of it is in any part extenuated) <hi>for</hi> (as the Apoſtle aſſureth vs) <hi>for ſuch things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the wrath of God vpon the children of diſobedience.</hi> And 1. Tim. 6.9.10. <hi>They that will be rich fall into tentation and ſnares, &amp; into many fooliſh and noiſome luſts, which drowne men in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For the deſire of money is the roote of all euill, which while ſome luſted after, they haue erred from the faith, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelues through with many ſorrows.</hi> Sorrowes, becauſe he hath preſently no more, as one wanting contentment: ſorrowes, becauſe his wealth increaſeth no faſter: ſorrowes for loſſes, which are alwayes very tedious to the couetous: ſorrowes in beholding other men to proſper better then himſelfe: ſorrowes euery way, becauſe he hath no more ioy of that which he hath, then of that which hee hath not. But that which at this time is to our ſpeciall purpoſe, is this which the Apoſtle affirmeth, that couetouſneſſe drowneth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12614:64"/> men in perdition and deſtruction. And as our Sauior Chriſt teacheth, The thorny cares of this world, and the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of riches, and voluptuous liuing ſo choake the word, &amp; make ſuch kind of men vnfruitfull: that they can no more be ſaued, then they who are like the high way, where the good ſeed of the word can make no entrance. Matth. 13.19.20. Luke 8. verſ. 12.14. wherefore alſo chap. 6.24. he denounceth the wo againſt vnmercifull rich men, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their conſolation here: according to that in the 17. Pſ. verſe 14. <hi>They haue their portion in this life.</hi> According alſo to the Parable of the vnmercifull and voluptuous rich man in the 16. chap. of the ſame Goſpell by Saint Luke: where in the 25. verſe our Sauiour Chriſt deſcribeth Abraham thus ſpeaking to the ſoule of the rich man being in hell-torments, and crauing onely ſome little mittigation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Sonne</hi> (ſaith Abraham) <hi>remember, thou in thy life time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuedſt thy pleaſures, and Lazarus paines: now therefore, hee is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> This is that which is ſaid in the 69. Pſalme, verſe 22. concerning the wicked: that <hi>Their table is a ſnare vnto them, and their proſperitie their ruine,</hi> to wit, becauſe of their abuſe thereof. Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therfore doth the Prophet pray, that the righteous might rather ſmite him, then that he ſhould feede of delicates with the wicked, Pſalm. 141. And iuſtly may it admoniſh all, to hearken to the holy admonition of the 62. Pſal. <hi>Truſt not in oppreſſion, nor in robberie, be not vaine: If riches increaſe ſet not your heart thereon.</hi> Yea, further, as Daniel coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth Nebuchadnezzar, that euerie one do ſpeedily break off his iniquitie by ſhewing mercie to the poore. Dan. 4. verſe 24. For otherwiſe, as the Lord earneſtly affirmeth, Ezek. chap. 18. verſe 18. <hi>He that hath not done good among his people, lo euen hee dieth</hi> (that is, he ſhall be ſure to die) <hi>in his iniquitie.</hi> As though the Lord ſhould ſay, he may be as ſure he ſhall die, as if he were dead alreadie.

               <p>But among all places, teſtifying and confirming the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting deſtruction of vnmercifull men, there is none more piercing and mightie to waken the ſoule of the moſt hard hearted man (if any admonition or rouſing will waken him) then that which is ſet downe by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt Matthew, chap. 25. verſes 41, 42, 43, &amp;c. where he recordeth how our Sauiour Chriſt deſcribed his laſt iudgement, and the manner of his proceeding in the ſame, and namely againſt vnmercifull men, which is the common ſin of all wicked men. <hi>Depart from me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the diuell and his Angels. For I was hungry, and ye gaue me no meat: I thirſted, but ye gaue me no drinke: I was a ſtranger, and ye lodged me not: I was naked, and ye clothed me not: ſicke and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> And whereas vnmercifull men thinke that they haue a ſufficient excuſe, becauſe that they neuer ſawe Chriſt himſelfe hungrie, or thirſtie, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſicke, or in priſon; as though if they had ſo done, they would haue miniſtred vnto him: he profeſſeth before hand, that he will anſwere them and ſay, <hi>Verily in ſo much as ye did it not to the leaſt of theſe,</hi> (that is to ſay, of poore diſtreſſed Chriſtians, whom before Chriſt called his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,) <hi>ye did it not to me.</hi> And therefore hee concludeth againſt all that neglect to ſhew mercie, whatſoeuer they can alleage for themſelues: that they ſhall go into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting paine.</p>
               <p>Now if any would know, why our Sauiour Chriſt chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to make mention only of this ſinne of vnmercifulnes, ſeeing hee ſhall come in iudgement to giue ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſinne and all ſinners: beſide that which was euen now mentioned, that this ſinne is vſually one in euery wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man: the reaſon may furthermore be this; euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſinne is a moſt manifeſt conuiction that ſuch as lye in it, are not of God, but of their father the diuell: and therefore that they belong to him wholly, and haue no part or portion in the Lord. For in like manner, as anie are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12614:65"/> more mercifull then other, ſo do they thereby more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew themſelues to be the true children of their heauen lie father: euen ſo on the contrarie, as anie are more cruell or mercileſſe, they more apparantly declare themſelues to be the very children of the diuel: who, as our Sauior Chriſt ſaith in the 8. chap. of Iohn, was a murtherer, and the father thereof, from the beginning of the world. And howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and vnbeſeeming a thing, I pray you, is this, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the kindly children of God, and liuely members of the myſticall body of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould preferre his ſiluer or his gold, his houſe or his land, before his Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or ſiſter, bought with the moſt precious bloud of Chriſt, in compariſon whereof all ſiluer and gold is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, yea moſt vile droſſe? A righteous man (as it is in the holy Prouerbe) regardeth the life of his beaſt, chap. 12.10. and therefore verie brutiſh are they, who pity not the liues of thoſe that be heires of heauenly grace, and the elect ſons and daughters of the moſt high God, creator and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee, how euery way in this life, and for euer in the world to come, the puniſhment of profane, illiberall, couetous and vnmercifull men is manifold and grieuous.</p>
               <p>O therfore, that all would lay the conſideration of theſe things diligently to heart, the vnmercifull &amp; illiberal man, that he might come to the conſcience and remorſe of his ſinne, and take warning to learne to do well. O that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, who haue chiefe power on earth to aduance the publike worſhip of God, and all ſuch as haue the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the liuings and maintenance of the miniſters of the Goſpel, wold duly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that they might prouoke themſelues to be more and more carefull in the beſt maner and courſe of beſtowing of them.

O that euery Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would well ponder the ſame things, that their hearts might be inlarged to a more liberall contribution, for the reliefe of the poore in all collections made to that purpoſe. O that Landlords would well thinke of them, that they might be moued to deale fauourably with their poore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and to abſtaine from all hard racking and inpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of rents, taking away of their commons, of fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their good leaſes by captious aduantages, &amp;c. O that Officers and Gouernours in corporations, and other townes, where money or landes haue bene giuen for the reliefe of the poore, would ſo mind theſe fearefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt vnmercifull men, that they may in no wiſe diuert the merciful gift of others, from that good vſe &amp; end wherfore they haue giuen it. O that euerie one to whom at any time, the holy legacies of the laſt will and teſtament of any beneficiall Chriſtians deceaſed, would ſo looke vpon the iudgements of God, that they might therby be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſhed to deale well and faithfully, according to that truſt which is committed vnto them, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their ſinne muſt needes be double, if they ſhall be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous and vnmercifull in withholding another mans libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, beſide their owne: yea and becauſe they do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſacrilegiouſly conceale and fruſtrate the glorious worke of the holy Spirit of God, which he had wrought as his laſt worke here in this life, in the hearts and ſpirits of his good and faithfull children.

Had it not, I pray you, euen in euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable mans iudgement, bene far better for them to haue learned from the fruitfulneſſe of their fieldes, and all the bountifull prouiſion of God, both for their backes and for their bellies, to yeeld their owne bounden fruits of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, &amp; for his ſake the fruits of loue to his poore children: then that they ſhould be like barren ground, to yeeld no good fruite, and ſo to make themſelues neare to curſing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Heb. 6.8. yea euen to pull downe ſodaine deſtruction and the fire of Gods euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wrath vpon them? I will pull downe my barnes, faith one, I will poure into my belly, ſaith another. But in the meane while, they altogether neglect the right way of building their head-houſes; neither once conſider they, that the vſe of aboundance conſiſteth rather in pouring out to the hungrie, then in pouring into the full belly; in relieuing and ſupplying the neceſſities of the Saints, then in following a voluptuous courſe of life, as hath bene alreadie declared.</p>
               <p>That courſe therefore, which euery man iudgeth, would haue proued happineſſe to them, if they had in due time ſought after it, before extreme and endleſſe miſerie fell vpon them: let vs, while we haue time, being thus forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their lamentable example, labour for grace, that we may lay hold of it, and ſo through the endleſſe mercie of God be for euer happy and bleſſed men.

                     <p>It is the very law of nature indeed, that Parents ſhould prouide for their children; and therefore they that do not ſo, are in this point worſe then heathen men, as the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirmeth, 1. Tim. 5.8. And againe, 2. Cor. 12.14. <hi>Fathers ought to lay vp for their children.</hi> Neuertheleſſe there is no queſtion but Chriſtian parentes muſt take a better courſe, then the beſt among heathen men or infidels doe, in prouiding, both for themſelues, and alſo for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as our Sauiour Chriſt (by whoſe Spirit the Apoſtle Paule ſpake) plainely teacheth, Matth. 6.31.32. Where, after he hath vſed many holy and heauenly reaſons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade diſtruſt in Gods fatherly prouidence, he concludeth thus: <hi>Therefore take no thought (ſaying) what ſhall we eate? or what ſhall we drinke? or wherewith ſhall we be clothed? (For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all theſe thinges</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <hi>ſeeke the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles) For your heauenly father knoweth ye haue neede of all theſe things. But ſeeke ye firſt the kingdome of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, &amp; all theſe things ſhall be caſt vnto you.</hi> Neither doth anie Scripture giue to vnderſtand; that we do not the part of Chriſtians, vnleſſe we labour to increaſe and bring our wealth and eſtate to this or that pitch: or to leaue euerie one of our children ſuch and ſuch a portion, as we preſume to aſſigne and appoint vnto them. It is farre from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12614:69"/> of Saint Paul, that anie one comandement of God ſhould be broken and troden vnder foote for another. Though Chriſtians ſtand bound by the lawe of God, to haue a godly care for the good and comfortable education of their children: yet haue they no warrant, for that cauſe, to neglect to exerciſe beneficence, and to ſhewe forth the fruites of common compaſſion and mercie. For this were the readie high-waie, for Parentes to ſpoile and vndoo both them ſelues, and their children for euer; rather then to better their eſtate here in this tranſitorie world. The beſt and onelie ſure prouiſion, which Parentes can make for their children, is to leaue vnto them, as it were a rich patrimonie, of true godlines. <hi>The righteous man</hi> (as ſaith the holie Prophet) <hi>is mercifull and lendeth, and his ſeede enioyeth the bleſſing Pſ.</hi> 37.26. And Pſ. 112.2. <hi>His ſeed ſhall be mightie vpon earth, the generation of the righteous ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> It is the faithfull parents godlineſſe therefore, and not his couetous aſpiring mind, gaſping and breathing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hundreths and thouſands, nor any laborious or cunning and craftie endeuour, the which maketh the beſt and ſafeſt prouiſion for the welfare of children, and childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For as touching the wicked, the contrarie curſe of God, is auouched, to be vpon their houſe and poſteritie, euen to roote it vp and to deſtroie it: Prou: 3.33. and ch. 14.11. He therefore (as one well writeth) rather vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth and betraieth his children, then faithfully prouideth for them, whoſoeuer is more carefull to leaue them an earthly then an heauenly patrimony: and to inrich them with worldly wealth, by filling their purſes, rather then with ſpirituall grace and vertue, by furniſhing of their ſouls by holy inſtructions, by faithfull prayers to God, and by Godly example of life.

For want whereof, wicked and vngodly thoughts and deuiſes are very rife in the minds of couetous and profane men, howſouer ſhame ſtoppeth their mouthes, that they do not at all times vtter &amp; vent them. But that we may vouchſafe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an anſwer. What though God be a Spirit, and requireth no curious nor ouer chargeable outward pompe, or ſuperſtitious decking to his ſpirituall ſeruice and worſhip? Is this any good reaſon, why all things ſhould not be decently ordered and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Or rather, is it not in all equitie, ſo much the greater reaſon, that all things ought to be diſpoſed in ſo much the more comely &amp; reuerend maner, becauſe the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no exceſſiue coſt to be beſtowed this way? It can by no colour of reaſon be denied. This therefore is a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and maligna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t obiection. And for the ſame cauſe alſo it is the leſſe to be maruelled at, though this kind of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grudge at the Miniſter of the Goſpell his allowance and maintenance, when they cannot willingly afford God him ſelfe a comely place for the exerciſe of his diuine worſhip; nor themſelues a ſmall quantitie of bread and wine, a fewe times in the yeare, for their ſpeciall comfort and ſpirituall nouriſhment of their ſoules.</p>
                     <p>As touching tithes by ciuill authoritie alloted for the maintenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, it is a mere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil to preiudice them vnder the name of Leuitical ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For there was tithing before there was any tribe of Leui, yea before Leui the father of the Leuits was borne; &amp; therfore alſo is it writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Leui, Heb. 7.9.10. that while he was yet in the loines of his father Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he paid tithes in Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Melchi-ſedec met him.

                     <p>It is nothing materiall therefore, what profane and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minded men thinke or ſpeake; ſeeing they knowe not, neither greatly regard, what they either deny or affirme, but onely as may ſerue their owne vngodly turne.

Thou profeſſeſt to ſeeke thy eaſe, and to eate and drinke, and to bee merrie, as thy couetous and vnmercifull brother did in the parable of the Goſpell, who ſuddenlie was taken away from all his riches and pleaſure. Luke ch. 12. Wherfore maieſt thou not iuſtly feare to haue the like portion with him?

Howſoeuer in receuing the giftes of Chriſtian beneficence, ſpecially at the hands of meaner perſons, that Courtlike curteſie is not vſed nor looked for, neuertheleſſe (in ſo much as they are the moſt honourable kind of giftes which can be giuen, ſeeing they are giuen for the Lords cauſe and with a holy and ſanctified affection) it is verie meete that they who are made partakers of them, ſhould in the moſt holy and religious maner receiue them, euen as from the moſt holy hand of God himſelfe, whoſe worke onely it is, to frame the hearts of his ſeruants, as it were by the finger of the holy Ghoſt, to beſtowe the ſame vpon them.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe therefore, let vs, I beſeech you, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der firſt of all, more fully of that which ſtandeth in the firſt place, and as it were in the forefront, of the right maner of receiuing a Chriſtian gift: namely, that it muſt be a modeſt and ſober receiuing. Whereby euen in the firſt onſet, not onely all flatterie and counterfeiting of pouertie, for the procuring of gifts, is preuented; but alſo, euen the verie roote hereof, which is a couetous, or greedy and lingering deſire after a gift is plucked vp. Both which are very ſeruile vices, vtterly vnbeſeeming that holy freedome and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mind, which the pooreſt of Gods ſeruants, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the miniſters of the Goſpell, ought to retaine in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. And hereof we haue the Apoſtle of our Sauior Chriſt and other of his ſeruants ſet forth vnto vs, for moſt worthy patternes and examples. And namely Saint Paule, together
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12614:76"/> with Siluanus and Timotheus: as we reade 1 Theſ. chap. 2.5. where the Apoſtle thus writeth, <hi>We did neuer vſe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring words, as ye know, nor coloured couetouſneſſe, God is record,</hi> And againe, 2. Cor. 2.17. <hi>We are not as many, which make merchandiſe of the word of God: but as of ſincerity, but as of God in the ſight of God ſpeake we in Chriſt.</hi> And more particularly concerning himſelf, he ſolemnly proteſteth before the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church of Epheſus, &amp; other Chriſtians: Act. 20.33.34.35. in the words following: <hi>I haue coueted no mans ſiluer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nor gold, nor apparell: yea, ye knowe that theſe hands haue miniſtred to my neceſſities, and to them that were with me.</hi> And he addeth further for the inſtruction of others <hi>I haue ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labouring, ye ought to ſupport the weake, and to remember the words of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, how that he ſayd, It is a bleſſed thing to giue, rather then to receiue.</hi> In the which words, beſide the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, worthy all imitation of euery ſeruant of God, vpon like occaſion, ſo farre as they may attaine vnto: we haue furthermore two notable reaſons to diſſwade couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and euery euill fruit thereof. Firſt, becauſe euery one ſtandeth by generall bond of Chriſtian dutie, ſtreightly bound to ſupport the weake, and therfore not to be aboue meaſure chargeable: ſecondly, becauſe (as our Sauiour Chriſt hath affirmed) it is a more bleſſed thing to giue then to receiue: and therefore conſequently, that euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to be more deſirous in his hart, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more prouident and diligent in the ordering of all his affaires, that he may rather be able to giue to others, then to ſtand in need to receiue reliefe himſelfe. Not that any through pride and haughtineſſe of mind, or of any other nice or ſcrupulous conceit, ſhould diſdaine or make ouer much deintie to take a gift in time of his need, as was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the beginning: for euen our Sauiour Chriſt himſelf receiued and accepted earthly benefites at the hands of his diſciples, who receiued more excellent gifts, euen ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces, and the moſt rich gift of eternall life and glorie
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12614:77"/> from him: And beſides, he that is not an humble man, can neither be trulie thankfull to God, nor yet to man. The meaning therfore of our Sauior Chriſt, as alſo of his Apoſtle Paul, guided by his Spirit, was no doubt, that no man through ſluggiſhnes and deſire of eaſe, or through couetouſneſſe in ſeeking to inrich himſelfe, ſhould growe ouerburthenſome, and ſo diſcourage weak Chriſtians from continuing in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell, if by reaſon of any exceſſiue charge of contributions, ſpeciallie in ſuch times, wherin the Churches are impoueriſhed by affliction and perſecution.</p>
               <p>Behold therefore, how it is a bleſſed thing to giue rather then to receiue: that is to ſay, to be diligent Bees, euerie one in his vocation and calling; rather then idle and deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring drones: to comfort and refreſh the heartes of others, rather then to ſeeke to ſatiſfie our owne vnſatiable deſires: to be rich to Godward, in the good works of mercy which he requireth and will plentifullie rewarde; rather then to heape vp a ſuperfluous maſſe of riches to our ſelues, to the impoueriſhing, or rather to the vtter deſtruction of our ſoules: finallie, by doing good to others, to gather people vnto God; rather then by beeing ouercheargable on the one hand, or by withholding beneficence on the other hand, if we be able to giue, to diſcourage and ſcatter the flock, to the decaie of the publike profeſſion of the religion and worſhip of God, and to the hazard of manie ſoules, that might ſtumble and fall hereby. Moreouer, as it is ſaid of the borrower, ſo may we ſay of him that hunteth after gifts, that he is a ſeruant, yea, ſeruily minded toward him that giueth. Such a one is not his owne man, as we may ſay, much leſſe is he fit to be a free ſeruant of the Lord. He is in the high way to grow quickly a flatterer, &amp; a man pleaſer, to proue an hypocrit, rather then a ſincere &amp; true profeſſor.</p>
               <p>But let vs returne to the excellent example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paule, who in that he writeth to the Philip. chap. 4.10. &amp;c. is likewiſe a notable preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto vs, how we ought to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12614:77"/> keepe our mindes ſober and free, againſt the inordinate and couetous deſire of gifts. He reioyced indeed, and ſingularlie commended the Chriſtians of Philippi, in ſo much as they had a ſingular care in communicating with him (as he there writeth) in the matter of giuing and Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuertheles, he reioiced not ſo much, for the ſupplie of his owne wantes, as to enioy the precious fruit of their faith and loue, and to thinke of that moſt excellent fruit, which was redounding to them, from the Lord againe. For (ſaith he as touching himſelfe) <hi>I haue learned in what eſtate ſoeuer I am, to be therewith content. I can be abaſed and I can abound: euery where in all things I am inſtructed both to be full, and to be hungry: and to abound, and to haue want I am able to do all things through the help of hCriſt, who ſtrengtheneth me. Notwithſtanding</hi> (as he further addeth) <hi>ye haue well done, that ye did communicate to mine affliction, &amp;c. Not that I deſire a gift but I deſire the fruit which may further your reckening, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, 1. Cor. 9.15. though he mightily preſſeth the equitie and moralitie of ordinary prouiſion and allowance for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, at the charge of the people, yet he profeſſeth, in regard of his extraordinarie calling of Apoſtleſhip, &amp; becauſe of certaine extraordinary occaſions in reſpect of certaine falſe Apoſtles, that he vſed none of thoſe things, neither wrote, that it ſhould be ſo done to him.</p>
               <p>Thus then, if we lay all theſe things together, we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently perceiue, both from the example of the Apoſtle Paule, and of other the ſeruants of God: as alſo from thoſe weighty reaſons, wherewith he hath inſtructed vs, how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly the minds, ſpecially of miniſters of the Goſpel, as was ſayd, ought to bee prepared and affected, touched the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of a gift. According to that which is expreſly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in euery one, that is to be accounted meete to be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the word, <hi>that he be not deſirous of filthy lucre.</hi> Nor haue his affection ſet vpon ſiluer. 1. Tim. 3.3. and Tit. 1.7. Read alſo Ier. 5.30.31.</p>
               <p>And verily, if we do not looke diligently to our hearts,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12614:78"/> that they beſober, yea verie warie and circumſpect this waie; both miniſters of the word, and alſo all other, are not onlie in great danger to falt in the receiuing of the holy beneficence and liberalitie of the good ſeruantes of God, which they giue to a right and, euen to incourage vs to walke on chearfullie in the waies of the Lord: but we ſhal be in danger, to offend much more grieuoſlie, in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and entertaining the giftes of ſuch, at whoſe handes we ought not at all to receiue them: either becauſe they giue them with a profane and corrupt minde, deſirous therby to binde vs to vnlawfull gratifications; or elſe, for that other weightie circumſtances, may make it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in expedient, to admit of anie gift from them: As for example; for want of this grace, Gehazi tooke giftes of Naaman the Syrian, notwithſtanding his Maſter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eliſha had, vpon verie holie and iuſt conſiderations, refuſed the ſame. As namely to the end he might the rather leaue him to conſider the free grace and mercie of God, in that greate cure, which was ſo miraculouſlie wrought vpon him. And alſo, that Eliſha might thereby approue himſelfe to the conſcience of that noble Syrian, that he was a true Prophet of God, ſeeking the glorie of the true God of Iſrael; and not one that was led by a couetous and earthlie affection.</p>
               <p>For want of this grace, as alſo becauſe he loued and lingered after giftes (which the Apoſtle Peter calleth the wages of vnrighteouſnes) Balaam that couetous Prophet, was willing, as a hireling, to haue ſerued king Balaaks malitious deſire, that he ſhould curſe and practiſe his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie againſt the people of God, had not the Lord himſelfe, againſt the will of Balaams falſe &amp; deceitfull heart, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and feared him from it.</p>
               <p>For the want of this garce, and likewiſe for the loue of the ſame vnrighteous wages, Iudas firſt played the thiefe, yea euen of that holie beneficence which was giuen to the moſt holie vſe that might be; to wit for the maintenance
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12614:78"/> of our Sauior Chriſt in ſuch ſeemlie maner, as was meet for the ſon of God, in the daies of his humiliation. Iohn 12.6. &amp; ſhortly after he betrayed his maiſter the ſame our Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: which was the moſt hainous treaſon that euer was wrought.</p>
               <p>For want of this grace, the Magiſtrate is eaſily drawne to peruert iuſtice, Exod. 28.21. and Deut. 16 19.</p>
               <p>Finally, couetouſnes and deſire of money, whether by gift from other, or by ſelfe inordinate practiſe, <hi>it is the roote of all euill,</hi> as the Apoſtle Paule teacheth, 1. Tim. 6.10.</p>
               <p>But on the contrarie, the Apoſtle Peter, according to that which we haue ſeene before in the Apoſtle Paul, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with this ſpirituall ſobriety, &amp; hauing his mind ſet on heauenly things: when he was tempted this way, he was ſo far from accepting the gift which Simon the magitian (one of like diſpoſition to Balaam) offered vnto him, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it. <hi>Thy money periſh with thee</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>becauſe thou thinkeſt the gift of God may be obtained with mony. Act.</hi> 8.20.</p>
               <p>Abraham alſo ſheweth a right noble mind in freedome this way. Gen. 14.22.23. For when the king of Sodom would haue giuen him much ſubſtance, of that which hee had recouered out of the hands of thoſe foure kings whom he purſued and ouercame; he vtterly refuſed, ſaying: <hi>I haue lift vp mine hand vnto the Lord, the moſt high God poſſeſſour of heauen &amp; earth, That I will not take of all that is thine, ſo much as a thred or ſhoo-latchet, leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay, I haue made A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham rich.</hi> The holy Patriarch had care, that God might haue his glorie in the fulfilling of that promiſe of bleſſing, which he had made vnto him, without any helpe from the heathen among whom he liued.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Prophete Daniel, chap. 5.17. anſwereth king Belſhazzar, who promiſed him great giftes, if he could interpret the writing that appeared vnto him: <hi>Keepe thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to thy ſelfe</hi> (ſaith Daniel) <hi>and giue thy giftes to another.</hi> Neuertheleſſe he read the writing, and ſhewed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof to the King.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:12614:79"/>
               <p>The Prophet Samuel, beeing a Iudge in Iſrael, may worthily be a notable example to all, both magiſtrates in ciuill iuſtice, and alſo to miniſters of the word of God. For he hauing the grace we ſpeake of, hath obtained this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie from the holy Ghoſt, that he tooke no bribe or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting gift at any mans hande. 1. Sam. 12.13. &amp;c. <hi>Behold here I am</hi> (ſaith Samuel in his Apologie, or in way of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp an accounte of his office of Iudge-ſhippe) <hi>beare ye record of me before the Lord, and before his annointed.

From whence eaſilie may it appeare, that the generall exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtle, is to great purpoſe. Heb. 13.5.6. in that he thus writeth to all Chriſtans. <hi>Let your conuerſation be without couetouſnes, and be ye content with thoſe thinges which ye haue: for he</hi> (that is God) <hi>hath ſaid, I will not leaue thee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake thee. So that we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper, neither will I feare what man can doe vnto me.</hi> Of like ſorte is the counſell of King Salomon Prou. 23.6. <hi>Eate thou not the bread of him that hath an euill eye.</hi> And the prayer of King Dauid his father. Pſal. 141. <hi>Let me not eate of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of the wicked: &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next grace and vertue, requiſite to the Chriſtan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of ſuch giftes and benefites, as may lawfully &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediently be receiued, for neceſſarie reliefe and comfort; it is Reuerence. For they muſt be receiued, not ſimple as from men; but with a reuerent regard of Gods ſpiciall goodnes, in mouing the heartes of his good ſeruantes and deare children, by his holy ſpirit, to haue ſo louing and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a care ouer vs. Yea, it is the part of all ſuch as are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured this way, ſo to conſider of Gods owne goodnes herein; that they may humblie acknowledge themſelues, vnworthy of ſo greate a grace and fauour: according to the example of Iaakob. Gen. 32.10. who ſaith vnto God, <hi>I am leſſe then any of thy benefites.</hi> And as King Dauid ſaith. 2. Sam. 7.18. <hi>Who am I ô Lord God, and what is my houſe that thou haſt brought me hetherto? &amp;c.</hi> Such humility (I ſay) ought to be in thoſe, that are ſuccoured by the honorable inſtrumentes of Gods bounteous goodnes and mercie. It is verilie (ſpecially in times of great diſtreſſe) no leſſe to be eſteemed, then if God ſhould cauſe the cloudes of heauen to raine downe Manna, as he did for the reliefe of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12614:80"/> according to that compariſon which the Apoſtle Paul maketh in the ſame reſpect,<note place="margin">A Gift is to be receiued reuerendlie.</note> 2. Cor. 8.15. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this eſtimation to be made of it, if ſuch be in any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner beneficiall to any, who were before ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their benefactors and had performed no dutie, whereby they might be induced therunto. Finally, to make this point of reuerend receiuing of benefites, more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and plaine: this we ſay, that the reuerence which is due to benefactors, is ſuch a reuerence, as belongeth from dutifull children, to their louing and kind parents. For in ſo much as they doe the part of parentes, to ſo manie as they doe relieue and cheriſh; it is good reaſon, that theſe againe, ſhould yeeld a childlike duetie and honour vnto them: according to the 5. commandement of almightie God: <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, we haue a good occaſion, after this mention of honour to proceed to ſpeake in the third place, of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: ſeeing this (beeing the third grace requiſite to to the Chriſtian receiuing of giftes) is alſo a fruite of that honourable &amp; reuerend account, which ought to be made of all good and beneficiall Patrons and friends. Of the which dutie, it behoueth euery one (whom it concerneth) to be the more carefull, becauſe it is the preſeruatiue, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certaine ſeed for multiplication of benefites. For to ſuch as ſhall be found truly thankfull, and walke in good dutie, the Lord will continue the beneficence of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, yea he will amplifie and inlarge them, ſo farre as he knoweth to be meete and expedient for any of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children.</p>
               <p>But it may be here obiected, that we muſt on all hands, giue all our thanks vnto God, ſeeing all good things come of his bountie alone; and he requireth it alſo, as a ſpiciall dutie of his worſhip, ſaying as we read in the 50. Pſal. <hi>Offer ye prayſe vnto God.</hi> And againe in the ſame Pſalm. <hi>He that offereth praiſe glorifieth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true; no man may deny it. God onely, is to bee
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12614:80"/> thanked and prayſed with religions &amp; diuine praiſe,<note place="margin">A Gift muſt be receiued thankefully.</note> which doe indeede belong onely to him that is the author and fountaine of all good things. Yea, moſt religious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant regard is to be had of all, both Giuer and Receiuer, that God may haue his pierleſſe &amp; continuall prayſe: as Pſ. 103, <hi>My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord, and all that is within me praiſe his holy name. My ſoule prayſe thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefits &amp;c.</hi> And Pſ. 146.2. <hi>I will prayſe the Lord during my life: as long as I haue any being, I will ſing vnto my God.</hi> Whereof, the reaſon is moſt iuſt and euident, inſomuch, as all doth altogether and alone proceed from his moſt bounteous hand, whatſoeuer any either high or low, doth enioy. Neuertheleſſe, this alſo is ſure and certaine, that it is well pleaſing vnto him, to be honoured in the meanes, yea to haue the meanes ciuilly honoured which he himſelfe honoureth firſt, that is, doth giue them the honour, to be his holy inſtruments for his peoples benefite. Thus, 1. Kings. 8.66. it is not recorded in vaine, that the people thanked, or beſſed K. Salomon, for his princely bountie in the ſacrifices &amp; offerings which he offered at the dedication of the holy Temple, and for that he alſo at his charge royally feaſted them. And Lament. 4.20. The Prophet Ieremie teacheth the Church of God, to account of Ioſiah their good King, to haue beene <hi>the breath of their noſtrelles:</hi> to wit, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable meanes of their preſeruation and defence, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer to ſpeak moſt exactly and abſolutely, God is the alone author and mainetainer of life, And 2. King. 13.14. Eliſha the Prophet of God is called <hi>the chariot and horſemen of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> in reſpect of the mightie force of his prayer, although to ſpeake ſimplie, the Lord onely is the munition &amp; defence of his people.</p>
               <p>But that we may further perceiue, that God alloweth a certaine honour to thoſe, whom he aduanceth to be his ſpeciall inſtruments, for the benefit and bleſſing of others: let vs conſider a litle of a few places of the holy Scripture, where, for honours ſake, he maketh ioynt-mention of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12614:81"/> them,<note place="margin">A Gift is to be receiued thankefully.</note> together with himſelfe, though there be indeed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ods betwixt his diuine nature and them. As Exod. 14. verſe 31. It is written, that when <hi>Iſrael ſawe the mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which the Lord ſhewed vpon the Egyptians: they feared the Lord, and beleeued the Lord, and his ſeruant Moſes.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording alſo to that, 2. Chron. ch. 20 verſ. 20. <hi>Put your truſt in the Lord your God</hi> (ſaith king Iehoſhaphat) <hi>and ye ſhall be aſſured: beleeue his Prophetes and ye ſhall proſper.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 1. Sam. 12.18. when the Lord at the prayer of Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, ſent a fearefull thunder and raine; all the people are ſaid to feare the Lord and Samuel exceedingly. In like maner 1. Chron. 29.20. So ſoone as Dauid had exhorted all the congregation, after their offering toward the building of the Temple, to bleſſe the Lord their God: it is ſayd: that <hi>all the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bleſſed the Lord God of their fathers, &amp; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining their heades, they bowed downe themſelues to the Lord and the king.</hi> Finally, Iudg. 7.20. The ſouldiers of Gideon crie, <hi>The ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon.</hi> Not that it was the ſword of Gideon, in euerie reſpect or in the principall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as it was the ſword of the Lord. Not that the people had altogether the ſame reſpect, in their bowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to God and to king Dauid. Not that they feared Samuel, as they feared God. Not that they beleeued Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or anie of the Prophetes, as they beleeued God. Finallie, not that the people thanked or bleſſed king Salomon, as they thanked and bleſſed the Lord. But as, where it is written of king Hezekiah and his Princes, that when they beheld Gods bountifulneſſe, in that prouiſion which the people yeelded for the maintenance of Gods worſhip, and the holie miniſters thereof, by bringnig in their Tithes and offerings, they did in the beholding the heapes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord and his people Iſrael,</hi> 2. Chron. 31.8. We muſt needs vnderſtand by their bleſſing of the Lord, that they prayſed him; and by their bleſſing of the people, that they did not ſo much commend them, as wiſh all peace &amp; proſperitie from the Lord vnto them. The like are we to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12614:81"/> do touching the peoples bleſſing of God, and bleſſing or thanking of their king. They bleſſe God with praiſes: they commend their king by their pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er to God for him. And ſo the ſword is Gideons, as the Lords Captaine; but it is the Lords owne ſword alone, as he is the Lord of all Hoſts, and the great Commander and Generall of the field. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple feared Samuel, in a reuerend acknowledging of him to be a true P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ophet of God: but they feared God, as wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, that he had a ſouereigne power ouer them either to ſaue or to deſtroy. Likewiſe they beleeued Moſes &amp; the reſt of the Prophets, as the faithfull meſſengers of the word and will of God: but they beleeue God, as the only author and performer of that truth, which they in the name, and at the commandement of God, publiſhed and preached vnto them. This difference &amp; diſtinction muſt we carefully and religiouſly obſerue in all things, leſt giuing vnto men, that which belongeth to them, we defraud God of that which is his due: and ſpecially in this dutie of praiſe and thankeſgiuing.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe therefore; in ſo much as it is an vſuall ſpeach of manie, to ſaie to their benefactors, I thanke God and you: left anie ſhould ſtumble, for want of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſcerne the difference, betwixt thankefulneſſe to God and thankefulnes to men; that is to ſay, betwixt humane or ciuill, and religious or diuine thankes, as we may call them: let vs helpe as well as wee can, to leade ſuch as want direction, as it were by the hande, that they may knowe ſome thing the better, how to diſtinguiſh the one from the other.</p>
               <p>This difference is to bee conſidered, partlie from the differing definition or nature of either kinde of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; and partlie from the differing fruites, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeuerall kindes, doo ſpring vp and growe from them. Vpon theſe points therfore let vs here pauſe a while.</p>
               <p>The differing nature of thankefulneſſe, is brieflie this;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:12614:82"/> that, <hi>Thankefulnes to God is a moſt reuerend, hearty and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgment of the benefit receiued, to the glorie and praiſe of God, as to the chiefe author and giuer of it.</hi> But thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to men, though it be, and ought to be, as hath bene declared before, a reuerend and heartie acknowledgment of the benefit receiued; yet it is not ſo much to the praiſe of the inſtrument, as to profeſſe and teſtifie, the willingnes of our heartes, to perfourme ſuch duties of thankfulnes, as do belong to ſuch kind of men, by the commandement of God. Here therefore, is a verie great difference, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> as they ſay; in way of more or leſſe: for the one is to be acknowledged the author, the other the inſtrument: the one God, the other man: he the creator, this the creature: he the glorious and almightie Lord, this the poore fraile ſeruant, &amp;c. Whereupon we may eaſilie perceiue, how carefullie the true ſeruantes of God are to abhor and auoide the groſſe and profane, or rather the ſacrilegious and blaſphemous flatteries, of all wicked Sycophants of the world. For they are ſo lauiſh in extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the meanes, that they reſerue nothing, as proper and entire to the Lord. Such was that blaſphemous and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flatterie of the people, who gaue proud Herod diuine glorie, Act. 12.22. they crying out with vehement accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſhouting, ſo ſoone as he had ended his oration: <hi>The voyce of God and not of man.</hi> Such alſo was the palpaple flatterie of Tertullus the Orator, in his fawning ſpeech to Felix, againſt the Apoſtle Paul, Act. 24. who in the name of the Iewes, aſcribeth all their peace wholly, &amp; in al things with al thanks to his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For what in effect could he haue ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lneſſe to God himſelfe? There is great cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why the faithfull ſeruants of God ſhould abandon this kind of heatheniſh and ſacrilegious gratulation, both from their hearts, and alſo from their tongues. For that which is aſcribed to man, yea euen to Caeſar, the chiefe among men, it is ſo onely to bee aſcribed and yeelded, that in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12614:82"/> wiſe (as was ſayd a little before) God be defrauded of any part and parcell of his moſt iuſt and ſouereigne due.<note place="margin">Exceſſiue thanks to men is to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But not only heathen men haue foulely faulted this way, but much rather the Church of Rome, which boaſteth it ſelfe to be the onely true Chriſtian and Catholike Church in the world, hath runne it ſelfe as it were ouer head and eares in this moſt grieuous and vnchriſtian ſinne. For if we compare the heathen and them together, we ſhall eaſily find that theſe do exceede them in moſt pernicious and deadly blaſphemy, lifting vp and aduancing creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all meaſure, not onely in aſcribing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voyce of God, and a prouidence concerning all earthly thinges, as Tertullus to Felix, but euen a commanding power for the eternall peace &amp; ſaluation of the ſoules of men in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: as is euident, in that which they do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the virgin Marie, whom they haue made the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Queene of heauen.

               <p>Hitherto of the difference of thankfulneſſe to God and to men, in reſpect of the nature and definition of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe; whereinto the euill effectes or fruites of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue thankes haue crept, and as it were ſtollen in, before we were ware of it.</p>
               <p>It followeth now, that we do further ſearch out the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, from the good fruites which ariſe from well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thankfulneſſe, both vnto God and alſo vnto men. Firſt therefore, the fruite of our thankfulneſſe to God, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his moſt prouident and fatherly care ouer vs, is ſo to acknowledge him to be our God, and the ſouereigne fountaine of our whole welfare, that we do wholly put our truſt in him, and depend vpon him, as one not onely to be honoured in the meanes, which it pleaſeth him to vſe for our benefite, but alſo aboue all ordinary meanes and helps yea contrarie to all aduerſarie and hurtfull meanes, if need ſo require. And for the ſame cauſe alſo, that in all our needs we runne to him by faithfull prayer and ſupplication, as to our neuer-failing refuge: and accordingly, to ſeeke to approue our ſelues, euen from the ſecretes of our ſoules and conſciences before him, according to the direction of his owne moſt holy and perfect commandement; we neuer ſatisfying our ſelues with that meaſure of thankes, which we ſhall at any time for the preſent attaine vnto. But the fruit of our thankfulneſſe to men is not ſo, but with the reuerent acknowledgment of them to be the gratious and honourable inſtruments of God, in all that they exhibite and reach forth vnto vs, we are onely to perfourme theſe duties following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that ſo long as they liue, we do continue our harty

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that wee, retaining a bleſſed memorie of them, doe alſo, vpon all meet occaſions, make honorable mention of them, and of their beneficence ſo long as wee liue our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that we be willing and deſirous to recompence them to our power, either in whole or in part, to them or theirs: yea euen to exceed the benefite receiued, if at anie time it ſhall pleaſe God to make vs able, and to giue vs iuſt occaſion thereunto.</p>
               <p>Finally, that for want of occaſions, or neceſſity on their parts that way, that we hauing receiued beneficence from the hands of other, do learne from their example, to bee as beneficiall to others as we may.</p>
               <p>Of theſe duties therefore, let vs henceforth treate a little for our further inſtruction: ſeeing theſe alſo are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened among the duties which belong to the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of a Gift; and is our matter in hand, ſtill depending to be be further inquired of.</p>
               <p>And firſt, concerning Prayer, the debt and conſcience of this dutie ariſeth from hence, that how rich ſouer they may be, and abounding in all worldly wealth, they do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe ſtand in continuall neede of the dayly bleſſing of God; the Factor whereof, as it were, faithfull and feruent or laborious prayer is, and that by aſſignement and letters of mart from God himſelfe. But what ſhall we intreat of the Lord in our prayers? and what may be the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, that our prayers are to procure for our benefactors? verily the beſt commodities aboue all other: namely, that it may pleaſe God to increaſe and multiply vpon them all ſpirituall graces and bleſſings in Chriſt Ieſus; that their ſoules eſpecially may fare well, ſo long as they liue here, and for euer in the life to come. For thus doth the Apoſtle Iohn teach vs by his owne practiſe and example, who left in holy record, what prayer he made for Gaius, a very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall and friendly Hoſt, to all the Chriſtians that reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12614:84"/> to him for ſuccour in his time. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith Saint Iohn in his third Epiſtle) <hi>I wiſh chiefly that thou mayeſt proſper, and farewell as thy ſoule proſpereth.</hi> The Apoſtle Iohn prayeth for Gaius, that he might ſtill, more and more proſper in all grace and godlineſſe, according to his happy beginnings, and proceedings alſo euen to the time that he wrote vnto him. Likewiſe, Saint Paul, Philip. ch. 4.17. prayeth for the Chriſtians of that Church, who had bene beneficialll vnto him; <hi>that their gift beſtowed vpon him, might further their reckening with the Lord.</hi> And 2. Tim. 1.16.17.18. he prayeth in like maner for his very good &amp; beneficial friend Oneſiphorus, and for his Chriſtian familie, in the Church of God at Epheſus. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith Paul in that chapter) <hi>giue mercie vnto the houſe of Oneſiphorus, for he oft refreſhed me &amp;c. The Lord graunt vnto him that he may find mercie with the Lord at that day.</hi> And if we would haue a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar example, I meane one of the more common ſort of thankfull perſons, we may take Naomi, in the booke of Ruth. ch. 2.20. who bleſſeth Boaz, for his ſingular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to her poore daughter in law, a ſtranger in Iſrael. <hi>Bleſſed be he of the Lord</hi> (ſaith Naomi) <hi>for he ceaſeth not to doe good to the liuing and to the dead.</hi> Her meaning is to note his conſtancie in doing good, as well now, as in former times, to thoſe that he hath ſuruiued: and namely (as it may be thought) to her owne husband, &amp; her two ſonnes, before they went downe into Moab, where they died. So then, in her praier to God, ſhe bewraieth her thankfull heart to Boaz, both in reſpect of her ſelfe, and daughter in law now; and alſo in remembrance of his former goodnes to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and her owne children deceaſed.</p>
               <p>Neither are ſuch as be any way ſuccoured and relieued, to pray onely for Chriſtian benefactors, but alſo euen for heathen and vnbeleeuing men, by whom they receiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite: according as King Darius requireth it, as a gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie fruite of his royall beneficence and bounty to the people of God; that they would pray for the Kings life,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12614:84"/> and for his ſons, Ezra 6.10. Yea, the Iewes while they were in Babylon, though they had ſmall fauor ſhewed them, yet becauſe there they were ſuffered to liue, the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to pray for the peace of the land, becauſe in the peace thereof, they themſelues were to haue their peace. Ier. 29.7. Much rather then ought we to pray for Chriſtian Princes, who are more tender foſter-fathers &amp; nurſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Church of Chriſt: &amp; for al other faithful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who do with more ſanctified harts, &amp; more deare loue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate their good things to their brethren. And in this reſpect, it may be accounted a very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable indeuour of thoſe Iewes, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we read, Luk. 7.4.5. in that they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, as much as they could, the ſuit which the Centurion of Capernaum made to our S. Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his ſick ſon rhey teſtifying &amp; alleaging, that he was a friend to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; had built a Synagogue for the worſhip of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally, in ſomuch as they which giue, or be the diſtributers of the holy benefice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of others, ought to pray that the ſame may be well accepted, &amp; ſo bleſſed of God, that it may incourage his ſeruants to cleaue conſtantly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, without any diſcouragement or fainting in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or wants; in ſo much as thereby they may perceiue that the Lord hath a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der watch ouer their neceſſities: for ſo doth the Apoſtle Paul pray himſelf, yea and deſireth the prayers of the Chriſtian Romanes alſo, that his ſeruice in this behalfe might be well accepted among the Chriſtians at Ieruſalem. Rom. chap. 15.31. Much more therfore ought they that receiue the benefit, pray for thoſe by whom they are benefited, that it would pleaſe God to giue them much ioy &amp; comfort, with manifold recompence for their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian contribution. And thus prayer to God for Benefactors is the firſt principall fruit and duty of Chriſtian and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thankfulneſſe vnto them.</p>
               <p>A ſecond fruit (as was ſayd) is, that we retaining a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full memoriall of their beneficence, do vpon all meet oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, make honourable mention of them. For ſeeing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12614:85"/> the Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Benefactors are to be well reported of.</note> that the memoriall of the iuſt ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Prou. 10.7. By whom ſhall this be perfourmed, rather then by ſuch, as haue moſt plentifully taſted of the fruite and benefit of their righteouſneſſe? And ſeeing God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath gone before vs, in ſolemnizing the memoriall of manie iuſt and mercifull men, in his holy Scriptures, as we may remember from the former catalogue of them; and ſo hath made the memoriall of them bleſſed: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith of that good woman, who poured her coſty ointement vpon him, that whereſoeuer his Goſpel ſhould be preached throughout all the world, there alſo ſhould this be ſpoken of, for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of her. Matth. 26.13. We may iuſtly from hence informe our ſelues of our duty herein. And the rather becauſe in the remembrance of the beneficence of our good patrons and friends, wee may the better put our ſelues in mind both of Gods bounteous goodneſſe to vs, &amp; alſo of our moſt bounden thankefulneſſe to him for the ſame. Finally, this thankefull memoriall, may be a meanes of ſtirring vp others, to the practiſe of the ſame vertue, which they ſhal perceiue, to be ſo acceptable, both to God, and alſo to all good men. Let this ſuffice for a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of this ſecond fruite of thankefulneſſe.</p>
               <p>The third fruite is, that though we be not able, yet that we haue a willing &amp; ſetled purpoſe, to make recompence, yea and to performe it indeede with aduantage, if at any time the neede of our benefactors or the neede of any of theirs ſhall ſo require, and God make vs able ſo to doe. <hi>He that hath friends</hi> (ſaith the holy Prouerb, ch. 18.24.) <hi>ought to ſhew himſelfe friendly: for a friend is nearer then a brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 21. ch. of Gen. ver. 22.23. &amp;c. Abraham iudgeth the requeſt of the King of Gerar equall in this reſpect; in that he ſaith: <hi>God is with thee, in al that thou doeſt. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſweare vnto me here by God</hi> (ſaith Abimelech and Phicol his chiefe captaine) <hi>that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor my childrens children: thou ſhalt deale with me, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12614:85"/> with the countrie where thou haſt bene a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Benefactors are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the kindnes which I haue ſhewed thee. Then Abram ſaid, I will ſweare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this reſpect alſo, is King Saul commended, as hauing done that which was equall and right, in fauouring the Kenites, who were the poſteritie of Iethro, the father in law of Moſes, becauſe more then three hundreth yeeres before, Iethro had dealt mercifullie toward the Iſraelites, at what time they came out of Egypt. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaith Saul to them, when at Gods commandement he made expedition againſt the Amalekites, vtterlie to deſtroie them with the ſword) <hi>depart, and get ye downe from the Amalekites, leſt I deſtroie ye with them: for ye ſhewed mercie to all the children of Iſrael. When they came vp from Egipt.</hi> Vpon which friendly watchword of the king, the Kenites ſeparated themſelues from the Amalekites, and were preſerued. This was one of thoſe fewe good thinges which K. Saul did; though in truth, becauſe of his falſe heart, he neither did this, nor any good thing elſe very well.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore from him proceede to the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy example of King Dauid, a king of the Lords making, not ſo much a ſucceſſor of wicked Saule, as the Anceſtor &amp; predeceſſour of all the holy kings of Iuda and Iſraell: who did not onely many good things; but alſo, by reaſon that God gaue him an vpright heart, he did them ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, let vs call to mind, what he did in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the kindnes of Ionathan, though Ionathan was then dead. The ſtorie is reported in the ſecond booke of Samuel chap. 9.1. &amp;c. in this wiſe: <hi>And Dauid ſaid, is there yet any man left of the houſe of Saule, that I may ſhew him mercie for Ionathans ſake? Now</hi> (as the holy Text ſaith) <hi>there was of the houſhold of Saule, a ſeruant, whoſe name was Ziba, and when they had called him vnto Dauid</hi> (for it appeareth that the king was earneſt in the matter) <hi>he ſaid to him, Art thou Ziba? And he ſaid, I thy ſeruant am hee. Then the King
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12614:86"/> ſaid, remaineth there yet none of the houſe of Saul, on whom I may ſhewe the mercie of God?</hi> (that is to vſe a fewe wordes of interpretation, the mercie which I ſtand bound to ſhew, for my othes ſake made to my faithfull friend Ionathan; euen ſingular kindneſſe and mercie, ſuch as God ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie requireth, and verie gratiouſly eſteemeth, according to that he ſaith (ſpecially concerning ſuch cauſes as this is) <hi>I will haue mercie and not ſacrifice). Ziba then anſwered the King, Ionathan hath yet a ſonne lame of his feete. Then the King ſayd vnto him, where is he. &amp;c. Who when he came to the King, he ſaid vnto him, feare not, for I will ſurelie ſhew thee kindneſſe for Ionathan thy fathers ſake, and I will reſtore thee all the fieldes of Saul thy father, and thou ſhalt eate bread at my table continually.</hi> And as it followeth in the 10. verſe of the chapter, King Dauid gaue Ziba charge, that he and his ſonnes and ſeruantes (whereof Ziba had to the number of fiue and thirtie, that is fifteene ſonnes, and twenty ſeruants) that they ſhould till the land, to the vſe and profite of Mephiboſheth, his Maſter Saules ſonne.</p>
               <p>I haue ſet this downe the more at large, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth an excellent patterne, of the moſt kind and holy recompence and retribution, which King Dauid made to the ſonne of the father deceaſed. Wherein let vs note, and with the annotation, let vs remember, as occaſion may require, to imitate this ſo memorable and worthy example, of a moſt godly King, ſo farre as any of vs ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be able to approch neare vnto him, in theſe foure vertues following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the care of ſeeking out the occaſion, when it is not brought and preſented vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in cheerefulneſſe, when the occaſion is found out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in louing and courteous dealing with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who is to receiue the benefit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the bounteous performance of the liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie intended.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:12614:86"/>
               <p>Yea, and let vs adde to theſe, a fift vertue; that this, the conſtancie of King Dauids kindneſſe, whereof we haue a further teſtimonie, in the 12. chap. of the ſame 2. booke of Samuel, where he excepteth and preſerueth Mephiboſheth, from that execution, which was done vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſonnes of Saul, at the requeſt of the Gibeonites, euen as God himſelfe alſo would haue it, for a reuenge of Saules crueltie againſt the Gibeonites, contrarie to the othe, which Ioſhua and the people made to them, for the ſecuritie of their liues among them. For King Dauid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering ſeuen of the ſonnes of Saul, to be executed by the Gibeonites in way of pacification: it is written, that <hi>he had compaſſion on Mephiboſheth, the ſonne of Ionathan, the ſonne Saul; becauſe of the Lordes othe, which was betweene them, euen betweene Dauid and Ionathan the Sonne of Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (which is yet more) King Dauid was not onely mindfull to requite kindneſſe in his life time; but he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo, that kindneſſe ſhould not die with him. And therefore, 2. King. 2.7. he on his death bed chargeth his ſonne Salomon who was to ſucceed in his kingdome, that he ſhould ſhew kindneſſe to the ſonnes of Barzilla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Gileadite, and that he ſhould let them be among ſuch as ſhould eate bread at his table: for (ſaith King Dauid) they came to me, when I fled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Abſolom thy brother. As though he ſhould ſay to his ſonne Salomon, according to Salomons owne holy Prouerbe, chap. 27.10. Thine owne friend, and thy fathers friend, ſee thou forſake not. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now that Barzillai and his ſonnes came thus to Dauid; we may read it teſtified in the holy ſtorie, 2. Sam. 19.31. &amp;c. where alſo, it is recorded, how thankefull K. Dauid was to Berzillai himſelfe, and would preſently haue requited the kindneſſe of that dutie, which of bounden dutie, Barzillai was to performe vnto him. Neuertheleſſe, becauſe it was done in kindneſſe, and in time of neede; king Dauid was readie to haue requited it by and by, as it were into his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12614:87"/> boſome. <hi>Come with me</hi> (ſaith he to Barzillai) <hi>and I will feede thee with me in Heiruſalem.</hi> The which his offer when Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai refuſed, by reaſon of his age, alleaging that he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to liue a courtiers life: K. Dauid taketh with him his ſonne Chimham, and diſmiſſeth Barzillai, according to his owne liking, and promiſeth him all princely fauour and friendſhip, that might ſtand him in any ſteed. And yet not ſatisfying himſelfe with all this, he is carefull (as was ſayd before) to proſecute the recompence euen after his death, to Barzillai his children and poſteritie. Great therefore was the vertue of King Dauid in this noble poynt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributorie kindneſſe and beneficence.</p>
               <p>And we will yet the rather ſay ſo, if we ſhall conſider that which is furthermore recorded of him; how he had not onely this kind of regard toward all his friendes, of the people of God, as 1. Sam. chap. 30.26.27.28.29.30.31. but euen towardes ſtrangers alſo, yea euen to ſuch, as in common account, were no better then enemies. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he would not forget the kindneſſe, which anie ſhewed vnto him, in any time of his neede. And therefore, as we reade, 2 Samuel. chap. 10.1.2. After that the King of the Ammonits was dead, and Hanun his ſonne reigned in his ſteede: <hi>I will ſhew kindneſſe</hi> (ſaith King Dauid) <hi>vnto Hanun the ſonne of Naaſh, as his father ſhewed kindneſſe vnto me.</hi> And therefore he ſent Ambaſſadors to comfort Hanun for his father.</p>
               <p>Finally, the prayſe of King Dauids beneficiall minde ſhall liue, as long as there ſhall be any memoriall of the death and buriall of King Saul and Ionathan his ſonne: for beſide his mourning for their death, although Saul for his parte had dealt verie hardly againſt Dauid: he reioyced greatly, when it was told him, that whereas the Philiſtines had hanged their bodies vpon the wall of Bethſhan, the men of Iabeſh Gilead had taken them downe, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie buried them: <hi>Bleſſed are ye of the Lord</hi> (ſaith he to the men of Iabeſh Gilead) <hi>that ye haue ſhewed ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12614:87"/> to your Lord Saul, in that you haue buried him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now the Lord ſhewe mercie and truth to you: and I will recompence you this benifite, becauſe ye haue done this thing.</hi> 2. Sam. 2.5.6.</p>
               <p>As touching the kindneſſe and beneficence of K. Dauid, toward the worſhip of God, and his houe, as a fruit of his thankefulnes to him, I omit to ſpeake here, becauſe, that hath bene declared at large, in the former part of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, where the vertues required to this dutie haue bene layd forth: and wherein as we may remember king Dauid was an admirable mirrour to vs all. Worthie therefore is he to be looked vpon of all, as a ſingular patterne, in all kind of beneficence; but ſpecially of Chriſtian Kings and Princes, who by the grace and bountie of God vpon them, in their royall eſtate, may come nearer to him, in their rich and plenteous beneficence, then anie of inferiour degree can doe.</p>
               <p>But let vs (deſiring God, the God of all grace, to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the heartes of all Chriſtian Kings and Princes, with that meaſure of bountie, which is beſeeming their high places, euen from his infinite bountifulneſſe) let vs (I ſay) returne with Barzillai, to walke anſwereable to our owne more meane eſtate and condition. This is once for all a certaine truth, that whoſoeuer receiue beneficence, they are made thereby (as they ſpeake) <hi>Beneficiarij,</hi> that is, deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſtanding bound to performe all good dutie to their benefoctors: and namely to that dutie, which the learned doe likewiſe expreſſe,<note place="margin">ANTIPELAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIA, a mutuall and interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a good turn or benefit.</note> by the greeke word <hi>Antipelargie</hi> borrowed from the name and naturall proſperitie, which they write to be in the yong Storke, which feedeth the damme when ſhe is old, and ſtandeth in neede of helpe. In reſpect of which propertie of the Storke (whereof mention is made Ier. ch. 8.7. <hi>Euen the Storke in the aire knoweth her appointed time &amp;c.</hi>) it ſeemeth, that in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe language, ſhe is called <hi>Chaſidah</hi> of <hi>Cheſedh</hi> which ſignifieth goodnes, mercifulneſſe, or a gratefull affection
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12614:88"/> &amp;c. And there is good reaſon, as hath bene obſerued before; that ſeeing liberall Benefactors take vpon them the affection and office of Parentes; they ſhould haue the dutie of children returned to them againe, from ſuch as enioy the fruit of ſo parentlike an affection.</p>
               <p>The equitie of this compenſation or recompence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is plainelie pointed at by the Apoſtle Paul, 2. Cor. ch. 8. verſes 13.14. in that, after manie other reaſons, alleaged to moue them to liberalitie, toward the poore Chriſtians of Ieruſalem; he addeth this, which nowe we ſpeake of, in theſe wordes. Neither is it (ſaieth he) that other men ſhould be eaſed and you grieued. But vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like condition, at this time your aboundance ſupplieth their lacke, that alſo their aboundance maie be for your lacke, that there may be equalitie. As it is written, (to wit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Iſraelites manner of gathering Manna deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Exod. ch. 16. verſes 16.17.18.) He that gathered much, had nothing ouer, and he that gathered litle, had not the leſſe.</p>
               <p>But maie not the recompence be made otherwiſe then in the ſame kinde? If we had time and authoritie, here to appoint an Act, and that it might bee philoſophicallie diſputed and determined; I would deſire no better mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, then wiſe Seneca, who in his 3. booke <hi>De Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cijs,</hi> from the 29. ch. to the end of the booke, verie wittilie handleth this queſtion: <hi>Whether children may not beſtowe as great benefites vpon their Parentes, as they haue receiued of them.</hi> And he bringeth manie inſtances, how neare at the leaſt, they maie attaine vnto it; if not in ſome caſes exceed them. His purpoſe in this his diſputation, is to verie good ende, namelie to prouoke, and incourage or whet on children hereby, to ſtriue vnto all good dutie and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to their Parents, as to their chief benefactors. Read him as a heathen writer, and (as Eraſmus well iudgeth) thou wilt ſay he writeth in this, as in diuerſe other pointes, as a Chriſtian Philoſopher; howſoeuer in other thinges he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12614:88"/> himſelfe to be a Pagan or heathen man. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purpoſe in this his delightfull &amp; wittie diſputation, may appeare by his determination of the Queſtion: ſome of the words whereof I will here, with the good leaue (as I truſt) of the Chriſtian Reader, briefly and conciſely ſet downe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things (ſaith he, ſpeaking of his former diſcourſe, how children may equall their Parents beneficence, &amp;c.) they do not take away reuerence from Parentes, or make their children leſſe dutifull to them, but much better, &amp;c. Dutifull affection, or godly diſpoſition, will be ſo much the more chearely, if in this ſtrife of making recompence, it may ſet vpon it with hope of victorie, &amp;c. And if we doe not in this matter think thus, we ſhall giue liberty to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and make them ſluggiſh herein, when as we ought to ſpur them forward, and to ſay: Go to, ye well diſpoſed youthes, there is an honeſt controuerſie ſet on foote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt parents and children, whether haue beſtowed or receiued greater benefites. Surely they haue not gotten the victorie, becauſe they haue made the firſt chalenge: or be on the forehand. Onely take ye ſuch courage as is meet, and faint ye not, that ye may preuayle according to your deſire. Ye are not without Captaines or leaders in this ſo godly a fight, who ſtirre you vp to the like enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes with them, and bid ye march on in their footſteps, to obtaine the victorie oftentimes already won from parents. This is in the 36. chap. And chap. 38. This is the Engliſh of his words. No force of words, no power of wit can expreſſe how great a worke this is, how commendable, and how worthy that it ſhould neuer ſlip out of the remembrance of men, for anie to be able to ſay thus: I haue bene obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to my Parents, I haue ſubmitted my ſelfe to their gouernement, &amp;c. In this one thing haue I bene ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, that I would not be behind in benefites. I beſeech ye therefore to ſtriue ſtoutly, and though yee bee put to the worſe, come againe a freſh in battell aray:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12614:89"/> They are happie who get the victorie, they are happie alſo who are ouercome. What young man is more noble, then he that can ſay to himſelfe (for to another he may in no wiſe ſpeake it) I haue vanquiſhed my father by benefites? Who is more happie, then ſuch an ancient man, who hath iuſt cauſe to tell it, whitherſoeuer he commeth, that his ſonne hath beene more beneficiall or done more for him, then he hath done for his ſonne? And what is a more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing, then for a man to ouercome himſelfe? Thus we ſee how the Philoſopher diſputeth, and how he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth the queſtion of recompence, betwixt the child and the father. And he hath ſpoken as much, and to as good purpoſe, as anie of the Philoſophers haue ſpoken in this point. The which alſo, I haue beene bolde, thus farre forth to ſet downe, hoping that it may be conſidered with ſome good profite by Chriſtians, though from the penne of a heathen man.</p>
               <p>But becauſe we haue a more certaine and ſure rule to go by, both in this particulare, and generallie concerning the doctrine of recompence in all caſes, let vs now anſwere the queſtion demanded, from the moſt excellent and on lie perfect the wiſdome of God, out of holie Scriptures. I anſwer therfore, by a conceſſion and granting of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that a recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (through the bleſſing of God) may be ſome other waies then by benefites of the ſame kind aboundantlie made; as for example, when for earthlie bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, anie are made partakers of ſpiritual graces and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, the which vnequall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutation or change of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, the Lord moſt vſuallie worketh, by the hand and miniſterie of ſuch, to whom he hath committed the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his word and Goſpell: according as the Apoſtle Paul ſaith, If we haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owne vnto you ſpirituall thinges, is it a great thing if we reape your carnall thinges? 1. Cor. 9.11. And againe, in his epiſtle to Philemon, pleading with him for his vnfaithfull and runne-away ſeruant Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, that he would vpon his repentance, receiue him
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12614:89"/> againe for his ſake: <hi>I vvill recompence it</hi> (ſaieth Paule) <hi>albeit I do not ſay to thee, that thou oweſt to me euen thine owne ſelfe.</hi> Yea further Rom. 15.27. he treating about that great beneficence of manie Churches, ſent to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of Ieruſalem, then in diſtreſſe through the dearth; he is more bold to tell the Chriſtian Gentiles, that they are debtors vnto the chriſtian Iewes, euen for the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefits ſake of the Goſpel, which came vnto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles from them: according as it is written: <hi>The lawe ſhall go forth of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Ieruſalem.</hi> Iſai. 2. v. 3. And Pſ. 110.2. And therfore the Apoſtle concludeth, that in ſo much as the Gentiles are made partakers of the ſpirituall treaſures of the Iewes, their dutie is alſo to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to them in carnall thinges. But this pointe hath bene more fully handled before, from the beginning of the third chapter of the former part of the Treatiſe. Let vs therefore, leauing this point, haſt forward.</p>
               <p>Verilie Praier it ſelfe, from the faithful and feruent heart of euerie true Chriſtian, though they be priuate perſons, &amp; no Miniſters &amp; Preachers of the word; it is ſuch an almes out of ſuch a bleſſed treaſurie and ſtorehouſe, that it eaſilie counteruaileth the outward value of that externall almes, which the rich man taketh out of his purſe or coffer, yea though he open the ſtringes of his purſe wide, and ſtretch out his hand verie liberallie.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, the wideſt opening of the heart vnto Praier, muſt not ſhut out the care of retribution, no not in the ſame kind, whereby anie ſtand indebted, or not in the like meaſure, if ſo there be need, and if God giue abilitie to cauſe the meaſure to be preſſed downe, and to runne ouer, according to that which was affirmed before. Neither muſt it ſhut out the care of benefiting the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, of thoſe which haue beene good vnto vs. And here alſo, for want of a fitter place, let vs conſider from the example of the people of Iſrael, that it is a dutie of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, to honour ſpeciall good men, with ſpeciall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12614:90"/> honour euen after their death,<note place="margin">Benefited men euen thereby ſtand bound to be beneficiall.</note> in their buriall: for ſo it is written of the people of Iſrael, to their commendation, that they buried Iehoiada the high Prieſt, in the Citie of Dauid among the Kinges, becauſe he had done good in Iſraell, and toward God and his houſe. 2 Chro. ch 24.16.</p>
               <p>Now finally, as a helpe to this fruite of thankefulneſſe, by care of making recompence; it is neceſſarie, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans heart be a faithfull regiſter of all the kindneſſe and beneficence, which he is made partaker of. Yea, and becauſe the memorie of euery one of vs is leſſe apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what we owe, then what we make reckening to be due vnto vs; it were requiſite, that euerie one ſhould haue ſome booke of record, thereby to be holpen, by the ſight of white and blacke (as they ſay) to call to minde, from a long repetition of the yeares and times that are paſt, both from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in what meaſure, we haue bene ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by the beneficence &amp; mercifull releife of this and that good ſeruant of our God. Whereunto well may that ſerue, which was obſerued in the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this treatiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſimilitude which the Apoſtle alludeth vnto. Philip. 4.15.</p>
               <p>We haue bene long in this third fruit of thankefulneſſe. The fourth is this, that for want of occaſions to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to benefactors; or for want of neceſſitie on their partes, or their childrens, that we learne from their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by experience of Gods mercie by them, to be our ſelues the inſtruments of God, to exerciſe as much goodneſſe and mercie, as we may. And if we be not able from the purſe, yet by good counſell and holie inſtruction, by faithfull dealing, by that credit we haue with others, by earneſt ſute for them in good and honeſt cauſes, &amp;c For there ſhall doubtleſſe neuer want occaſions of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, one way or other, to thoſe that be beneficiallie and helpefully minded. The poore (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) ſhalbe alwaies with vs. And ſo long as ſinne is in the world; yea in the children of God, though not reigning, and as long as the children of this world are violent and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12614:90"/> to oppreſſe and deceiue, ſpecially the true ſeruants and children of God; and as long as the diuell their arch-ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, beareth any ſwaie in the world, &amp; ruleth in the hearts of the wicked, to puſh them forward to mallice and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the true worſhippers of God, of blind zeale to their owne falſe religion and ſuperſtition: Finally, ſo long as God himſelfe ſeeth it meete, yea good and profitable for his children to be humbled, and that their faith and patience ſhould be exerciſed &amp; tried (all which both wil &amp; ſhalbe, ſo long as this world laſteth) euen thus long therefore, will there be manifold occaſions, for the mercifull (who for the time are reſcued and ſpared of God) to ſhewe all kind of mercie and goodneſſe, to thoſe that be in preſent affliction. The which occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s al ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bound to take knowledge of, &amp; to tender and releiue all afflicted ones to their power; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will ſhew themſelues kindly children of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father; ſpecially (as was ſaid in the beginning) ſuch as haue had ſpeciall experience of Gods mercie, in the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As for thoſe, that ſhall not regard to doe thus; they may ſee in the parable, of him that taketh his brother by the throate, for a hundreth pence, notwithſtanding the king had forgiuen him a thouſand talents; what ſhalbe their portion, in the end. For the king his maſter, hearing of the outrage, by ſuch of the fellow-ſeruants, as were ſorrowfull beholders of it; he <hi>calleth him and ſaith to him, O euill ſeruant I forgaue thee all that debt, becauſe thou praiedſt me.

So his maſter was wroth, and deliuered him to the iaylors, till he ſhould pay all that was due to him,</hi> Mat. 18.23.24. &amp;c. Such ſhalbe the lot of all vnmercifull and vnthankfull men; ſpecially of ſuch, as hauing receiued mercie themſelues do, in ſtead of mercie, exerciſe crueltie againſt others. But of this more in the chapter following. Hetherto therfore of the foure fruits of true thankfulneſſe for benefits receiued, in ſuch order, as they were at the firſt ſet downe and mentioned.</p>

If all that we liue by, had bin gotten by the ſweat of our owne browes, yea &amp; though by our diligence &amp; induſtry we had obtained great wealth &amp; abundance; yet were we bound to vſe all that we enioy, ſoberly &amp; thriftily, without ſtripe or waſt, as they ſay. But much rather are we to do ſo, if aboue our owne care &amp; trauel, we be fed and maintained, either in whole or in part, with ſo holy a prouiſion, as is the contribution of thoſe, whom God honoreth with the name and title of his Saints.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12614:93"/> children. For ſeeing that all vnthankfulneſſe and neglect of dutie, euen to the vnworthieſt ſorte of benefactors, is ſinfull and diſpleaſing before God, and ſo conſequentlie verie iuſtlie ſubiect to his curſe: much rather then, is that ingratitude and vndutifulnes, which is called for, by ſo ſweete and amiable an intreatie, as is that voice as it were, which the holie and chriſtian beneficence of the Saintes of God, ſoundeth in our eares, condemned of God and all good men; and accordinglie, ſhall be more ſeuerelie puniſhed of God, vnleſſe thoſe that thus heinouſlie ſinne, preuent the puniſhment, by timelie repentance.</p>
               <p>Ingratitude is verie ſeuerelie condemned by that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of reaſon, which God hath reſerued in men: as maie appeare by the ſayinges of the heathen. All men (ſaith Cicero) hate ſuch as be vnmindefull of the good turne, which hath beene done vnto them. And againe, there is no euill wanting where ingratitude taketh place. Wherupon alſo, they haue iudged it worthy to be puniſhed by death. Why then hath it not bene ſo puniſhed among them, may ſome ſay? They themſelues render the reaſon, becauſe of the difficulties incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the proceeding, which would fall out in courſe of lawe againſt it. For the number of vnthankefull perſons (as they obſerued) is alwayes infinite, ſo that all courtes would not ſuffice, to heare and determine the cauſes and actions, that might this way be commenced. And further, ſay they, within what ſpace of time, ſhould a man, neglecting dutie, be arreſted and attached as an vnthankfull man? &amp;c. Therefore (ſaith Seneca ſpeaking in the name of the reſt) wee haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it, as worthie hatred, and we haue lefte it among thoſe thinge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which we commit to the reuenge of God. Onelie (ſaith he) the Macedonians made ingratiude liable to an action, and to beare ſute in lawe. And it is obſerued, concerning Alexander the Macedonian King, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iulius Caeſar, Emperour of Rome; that albeit the one did exceed in the bountifulneſſe of giuing, the other in the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12614:94"/> clemencie and fauour of forgiuing iniuries: yet neither would the one giue, nor the other forgiue vnto ſuch, as had before ſhewed themſelues vnthankfull.</p>
               <p>Nowe ſeeing heathen men are thus ſeuere againſt this ſinne; it is leſſe maruell, though ſuch writers, as haue beene inlightened and taught from the holie word, and Scriptures of God, doo ſo vehementlie inueigh againſt it, as we may reade that they doo. Ingratitude (ſaith one) ſeemeth to me to be a moſt grieuous vice, an vnworthie vice, ſuerlie, yea full of all indignitie. And an other: Deteſtable is the forgetfulnes of grace and fauour ſhewed, and all concealing of benefites beſtowed. But that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes paſſeth all (ſaith a third) which maketh the good will of him that hath deſerued well, the occaſion of his vnthankfulneſſe. For as experience ſheweth, ſome are ſo wicked, that they delight to ſpeake the worſt of thoſe that haue deſerued beſt of them. So true is it, that an other ſaieth: It is more ſafe to offend ſome; then to deſerue well at their hand. More ſafe (I ſaie) for the auoiding of their ill tongue; in ſo much as they ſeek to make proofe by their hatefull dealing that they are nothing beholding to a man.</p>
               <p>But leauing all other writers, let vs come to the holie Scriptures themſelues; and from them, learne what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord God (who in all thinges iudgeth moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgement) hath of this ſinne; and conſequentlie, what puniſhment he hath awarded againſt the fame.</p>
               <p>And firſt, let vs begin with vnthankefulnes to his owne moſt bounteous and diuine maieſtie; ſeeing vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to God, is the roote of all vnthankfulnes to men. And againe, vnthankfulnes to good men, redoundeth from man vpon God himſelfe, whoſe worke onelie, both the worke, and alſo all affection and diſpoſition of the heart of man to goodnes and mercie is. For, ſeeing (as our Sauiour Chriſt affirmeth) None is good ſaue one, which is God: Matth. 19.17. it muſt needes followe,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12614:94"/> that who ſoeuer hath anie ſparkle of true goodnes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to goodnes in him, he hath receiued it, as a grace from the good ſpirit of God. Wherfore, I doe willingly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that how ſoeuer it may ſeeme not ſo properly perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this Treatiſe, to ſpeak of vnthanfulnes to God: that yet I ſhall not perfourme altogether a thankleſſe office to beginne herewithall, and ſo proceede to that vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe which is in man toward man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore to lay forth the haynouſneſſe of the ſinne of vnthankfulneſſe to God, the onely fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that one place in the firſt chapter of Paules Epiſtle to the Romanes, verſes 21.22.23. may aboundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (ſaith the holy Apoſtle) <hi>are left without excuſe: Becauſe that when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankefull, but became vaine in their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, and their fooliſh heart was full of darkeneſſe. When they profeſſed themſelues to be wiſe they became fooles. For they turned the glorie of the incorruptible God into the ſimilitude of the image of corruptible man, and of birds, and of foure footed beaſts, and of creeping things, &amp;c.</hi> Behold here, what a great palpable darkeneſſe followeth vpon the putting out of the light of knowledge, by miſerable vnthankfulneſſe: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what a floud of wickedneſſe breaketh in, by the pulling vp of this ſluce as it were. For no doubt, if the Gentiles had bene thankefull to God, in any meaſure of truth, as they ought to haue bene, conſidering the Lord left not himſelf without witnes among them, as the ſame Apoſtle teſtified, Act. 14. verſe 17. <hi>in that he did good, and gaue them raine from heauen, and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling their heartes with ioy and gladneſſe:</hi> they had ſurely preuented all that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and outrage of iniquitie, which for want hereof they fell into.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing doth the ſame Apoſtle giue againe to vnderſtand, in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, chap. 5. verſe 4. in that he oppoſeth it vnto manie ſinnes: that is, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and all vncleanneſſe, and couetouſneſſe, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12614:95"/> filthines, and fooliſh talking, and ieſting, all which (as the Apoſtle telleth chriſtians) are thinges not comelie: in that (I ſaie) to all theſe vices, he oppoſeth this one ſingular vertue of Thankſgiuing. As though he ſhould ſaie, this ought to be as a ſtrong barre againſt all them; wheras on the contrarie, if thankfulnes to God be wanting, and no due conſideration had of his mercies; the doore is ſet wide open vnto them.</p>
               <p>Not without great cauſe therefore doth the Lord by his holy Prophet Iſaiah, chap. 1. ver. 2.3. &amp;c. ſo vehemently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his people for their vnthankfulneſſe vnto him, <hi>Heare ô heauens, &amp; hearken ô earth</hi> (ſaith Iſaiah) <hi>for the Lord hath ſaid, I haue nouriſhed and broght vp children, but they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt me. The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his maiſters cribbe, but Iſarael hath not knowne, my people hath not vnderſtood. Ah ſinfull nation, a people laden with iniquitie, &amp;c.</hi> So then, we may eaſily perceiue, that this ſinne muſt needs be a hainous ſinne, which traiterouſly letteth in ſo huge an hoſte of enemies to trouble heauen and earth as it were. What ſhall we therefore make leſſe of vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to God, then to be an vtter tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pling of all Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious benefits, bleſſings, and mercies vnder our feet? what ſhall we make it leſſe, then as a whirlepoole, or bottomleſſe pit to ſink, &amp; ſwallow vp, &amp; conſume the bleſſings of God, to no good vſe, how infinitly ſoeuer they be? Yea how can we make it leſſe then to be a moſt contemptuous lifting vp of the heele againſt God himſelfe, after the maner of the pampered beaſt, which very miſchieuouſly ſtriketh his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he hath all his prouender? Deut. 32.13. &amp;c. <hi>He that ſhould haue bene vpright, when he waxed fat ſpurned with his heele, &amp;c.</hi> Finally, what can any man make leſſe of it then a moſt rebellious arming of men, euen like Giants, to fight againſt God in heauen, as it were with his owne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie and weapons, here vpon earth?</p>
               <p>The ſin therefore being ſo hainous, how (thinke we) can it ſtand with the perfect iuſtice of God, that the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:12614:95"/> ſhould not accordingly be very ſharpe,<note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnes to God.</note> yea manifold and moſt grieuous and heauie? And verily, ſo it was vpon all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, as followeth in that firſt chapter of the propheſie of Iſaiah. For in reſpect of the ſundrie &amp; great plagues, which fell vpon them for the ſame their vnthankfulneſſe to God; they are compared, as it were to ſome ſpittle-houſe man, who hath no part ſound in him. For (as the Prophet frameth his deſcription of their pittifull eſtate) <hi>From the ſoale of the foote vnto the head there was nothing whole, but woundes, and ſwelling, and ſores full of corruption:</hi> &amp; that alſo <hi>without wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and binding vp,</hi> and <hi>without mollifying with oyle. &amp;c.</hi> Read alſo Pſal. 78. and Pſal. 106. The Apoſtle Paule alſo, in that his firſt chapter of the epiſt. to the Rom. alleaged before, ſheweth how horribly the Gentils were puniſhed for their vnthankfulnes, he writing thus of them, from the 24. verſe of the chapter. <hi>Wherefore alſo</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God gaue them vp to their hearts luſtes, vnto vncleanneſſe, to defile their own bodies betweene themſelues, &amp;c.</hi> And ver. 28. he openeth the cauſe of it. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as they regarded not to know God, euen ſo God deliuered them vp into a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are not conuenient. They being full of all vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, fornication, wickednes, couetouſnes, maliciouſnes, &amp;c.</hi> This verily is a moſt grieuous puniſhment, when one ſin of the wicked is puniſhed with another: that is, when they are giuen ouer from ſin to ſinne, howſoeuer the burthen of this puniſhment, which maketh way to all plague and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not diſcerned of the wicked. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore addeth further, chap. 2. verſ. 4.5. They that deſpiſe the <hi>riches of Gods bountifulneſſe, and patience, and long ſufferance, not knowing</hi> (that is, not regarding to know or conſider) <hi>that the bountifulneſſe of God leadeth to repentance: They do after the hardneſſe of their harts, that cannot repent, heape vp vnto themſelues wrath againſt the day of wrath, and of the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the iuſt iudgement of God, who wil reward euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his works, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe in the former place of the Epiſt. to the Epheſians: <hi>For ſuch things</hi> (that is, for ſuch vices
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12614:96"/> as breake forth and beare ſwaie among the wicked, for want of thankfulneſſe to God, as the Apoſtle had rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the words going before) <hi>the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of diſobedience.</hi> Vnthankefulneſſe it ſelfe, in that it is a neglect of dutie to God, is a great ſinne; and that which God puniſheth ſharply, in his owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like as we read of King Hezekiah, that good king, that wrath came vpon him from the Lord, becauſe he did not render to the Lord, according to the reward beſtowed vpon him, 2. Chron. 32.24.25.26. Howbeit, inſomuch as Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah beeing reproued, did humble himſelfe, both he and the inhabitantes of Ieruſalem, therefore they preuented the extremitie of Gods wrath, ſo as it fell not vpon them in the daies of Hezekiah. Now therefore, ſeeing the Lord cannot ſpare this ſinne, when it is found with neglect of dutie, in his beſt ſeruants for a time: how ſhould he not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it in the wicked, in whom vnthankefulneſſe is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained with a black gard of all kind of foule vices, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſinnes beſide? May it not be iuſtly ſayd to the ſhame of all ſuch, as Moſes ſpake to the vnthankefull Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Deut. 32.6. <hi>Doe ye ſo reward the Lord, ò ye fooliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and vnwiſe. Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? he hath made thee, and porportioned thee, &amp;c.</hi> And if for all this, they that be vnthankefull, will be vnthankfull ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the infinite mercies of God reuealed vpon vs, ſpecially now in the dayes of the Goſpell, both earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and heauenly mercies for body and ſoule, for this life and for euer, vpon our ſelues and all ours: which ought to inflame our heartes, to power forth perpetuall praiſes and thankes, to the glorie of his moſt bleſſed name, may we not iuſtly ſay further, as Moſes ſpake to the people? <hi>The fire ſhall kindle in Gods wrath, and burne to the bottome of hell, and conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the mountaines. The Lord will ſend plagues vpon them, and beſtow his arrowes vpon them. They ſhall be burnt with hunger, and conſumed with heate and bitter deſtruction.</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:12614:96"/> And may not the Lord himſelfe, as it is written, Pſal. 107. <hi>turn a fruitful land into barreneſſe, for the wickednes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dwell therein?</hi> Yea may he not iuſtly take away the hedge of his vineyard, &amp; break downe the wall therof, when in ſteed of ſweet grapes, it bringeth forth thoſe that be ſower and wild? That is, when there is oppreſſion in ſteed of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; crying out in ſteed of righteouſneſſe. Iſa. 5.5, &amp;c. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnthankfulnes, as hath bene declared, is both the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; alſo the nouriſher of all ſin, carying all ſin, as it were, in the wombe of it, like to thoſe moſt il-fauoured and leane kine, which did eate vp as many well liking and fat kine, but when they had eaten them vp, were ſtill as leane and ill-fauoured as at the beginning: of the which we read, Gen. 41 19.20.21. Wel therefore may the fulneſſe &amp; perfection of all wrath and puniſhment be caſt vpon all ſuch gurmandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Cormorants, who conſuming Gods bleſſings, yeeld no fruits of thankfulneſſe vnto him, but remaine continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leane, barren, and blaſted that way. <hi>The hope of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull ſhall melt away as the winter yee, and flow away as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable waters.</hi> Wiſdom. 16.29.</p>
               <p>And great reaſon, why vnthankfulneſſe to God ſhould bee ſo heinous in his ſight; and why alſo he ſhould pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it ſo ſeuerely, partly here, but more fully after this life ended: not only for the cauſes already alleaged, but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, as firſt, for that God doth in vaine ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly put ſuch vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful ones in mind of their duty herein, as Pſ. 50.14. <hi>Offer vnto God praiſe.</hi> And Eph. 5.20. <hi>Giue thanks alwayes for al things vnto God euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Likewiſe Philip. 4.6. Col. 4.2. 1. Theſ. 5.18. and in many other places.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe that which is in all equity a moſt due debt, is moſt vniuſtly denied &amp; withheld fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as 2. Theſ. 1.3. <hi>We ought to thank God alwayes, as is meet, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; ch. 2.13. <hi>We ought to giue thanks alway to God for you, brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> And if for others, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo much rather for Gods loue &amp; fauour, &amp; all the fruits thereof toward our ſelues. And Pſ. 29.2. <hi>Giue to the Lord the glory due to his name.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons of the puniſhment.</note>Thirdly, becauſe thankefulneſſe is a ſpeciall good dutie, wherewith the Lord is ſingularlie well pleaſed. as Pſal. 92.1.2. <hi>It is a good thing to prayſe the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And Pſal. 69.30.31. <hi>I will prayſe the name of God with a ſong, and magnifie him with thankeſgiuing. The which ſhall pleaſe the Lord better then to offer a young bullocke that hath hornes and hoofes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe it is as the ſingular ornament of our owne profeſſion of Gods holy worſhip, as Pſal. 33.1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the Lord, ô ye righteous: for it becommeth vpright men to be thankefull.</hi> And Pſal. 135.3. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for the Lord is good: ſing prayſes to his name, for it is a comely thing.</hi> And Pſal. 147.1. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for it is good to ſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our God: for it is a pleaſant thing, and prayſe is comely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe by our thankefulneſſe, we make ſpeciall profeſſion of our faith: and giue the greateſt glorie, we can yeeld vnto him, in the acknowledgement of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of his truth, in the performance of his promiſes, &amp;c. as Pſal. 66.1.2. &amp;c. <hi>Reioyce in the Lord ye inhabitantes of the earth. Sing forth the glorie of his name: make his prayſe glorious.</hi> And Pſal. 96.8. <hi>Giue vnto the Lord the glory of his name.</hi> And Pſal. 50.23, <hi>He that offereth praiſe glorifieth me:</hi> ſaith the Lord himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But on the contrarie, all vnthankfull perſons diſhonour God, they iuſtly diſpleaſe him: they diſgrace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: they ſhew themſelues void of faith: they tread vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote the commaundement of God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the ſinne of vnthankefulneſſe to God, how hanious it is in his owne nature, and in the ſight of God; and accordingly, how greuious the puniſhment is, which in the iuſtice of God, belongeth vnto it. It followeth, that we conſider likewiſe, of vnthankfulneſſe to men, both how greuious the ſinne is, and alſo who ſeuerely God will puniſh it, according to the teſtimonies of his holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as was propounded and determined before.</p>
               <p>Concerning the greatneſſe of the ſinne of vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, betwixt man and man, that place of holy Scripture,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12614:97"/> 2. Tim. 3.1. among ſundrie other places,<note place="margin">The greatnes of the ſin of vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to men.</note> may iuſtlie be one; where the Apoſtle rehearſeth it among thoſe hainous and noiſome ſinnes, by the abounding whereof, the times ſhould growe verie perillous in the laſt daies. For men (ſaith the Apoſtle Paul) ſhall bee louers of their owne ſelues, couetous, boaſters, proud, curſed ſpeakers, diſobedient to parentes, vnthankfull, &amp;c. vnthankfulnes therfore, being one ſpeciall ſinne, Whereby the times will growe perillous, or grieuous and tedious, yea euen to good &amp; merciful men, while they ſhall ſee all beneficence troden vnder foote and peruerted, by the which, they would gladlie drawe manie to the loue and obedience of the Goſpell of God: it can not be leſſe eſteemed, then for a verie hainous ſinne. And the rather alſo, becauſe not onelie the beneficence of other good Chriſtians, cannot preuaile to drawe them to the loue of godlines; but euen the beneficence and all reuerence which is due to Parents, is eaſilie deſpiſed of vnthankefull perſons. For if children ſhall deſpiſe their Parentes, and all that they haue done for them, in the care and coſt of their education: whom then will they regard? To whom can they be ingenuouſlie thankfull?</p>
               <p>And therefore is it alſo, that in his diuine wiſedom, our S. Chriſt doth ſo vehementlie inueigh, and cry out againſt the Phariſies, who by their blinde and couetous traditions, hindered the thankefulnes, and remuneration and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which children owe to their poore Parentes; they thereby making the lawe of God (namelie, the fift commandement, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother</hi>) of no authoritie as our Sauiour chargeth them Mat. 15.3.4.5. &amp;c. And Iohn ch. 10.31.32. and before that, ch. 8.44. he conuicteth manie of the Iewes, to be the children of the Deuill, and not of God; becauſe they went about to ſtone him, who had wrought manie good workes among them. And verilie, infinit was the goodnes, and mercie, &amp; beneficence, which our Sauior Chriſt wrought, aboue all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:12614:98"/> other men, that euer were, both to the ſoules and alſo to the bodies, of an infinite number of men, while he was in his humanitie here vpon the earth; though indeede, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed no great ſummes of money among them. And yet behold, al was not able to ſubdue this furie of vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, which had bereaued them of all dutifull regard of his good workes wrought among them. See therefore the ſtrange nature of this ſinne, which where it taketh place, breedeth the greateſt trouble and diſquietment, yea the greateſt malice and outrage that may be; further then it is curbed and reſtrained by the almightie power of God, which onely is able to ſuppreſſe the furie of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, we are againe to obſerue, that albeit vnthankfulneſſe to men, did reſt onely in the neglect of the dutie of thankes; yet were it to be condemned much more among Chriſtians, then among the heathen, whoſe great hatred againſt it, we haue ſeene teſtified before. And ſo we find it noted, to the reproofe of Pharaohs butler, Gen. ch. 40.23. becauſe he did ſo long forget Ioſeph, who had bene ſo great a comfort to him, while he remained in priſon with him; yea, becauſe he forgat him, although Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph had intreated the Butler to ſhew him mercie, and to be a meanes to Pharaoh that he might be deliuered out of his vniuſt impriſonment. But we ſee that vnthankfulneſſe to men goeth not alone, likewiſe as we ſaw before, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe to God, goeth not without an vnruly traine. And therefore alſo, it maketh it ſelfe ſo much the more hainous and troubleſome or grieuous, as the other hath ſhewed it ſelfe to be. Whereupon, let this now be noted, for a graue and weightie admonition to all, that ſo ſoone as the heart ceaſeth to be thankfull, for benefites receiued of good and mercifull men, ſo ſoone doth it begin to grow hurtfull and pernicious againſt men.</p>
               <p>The which admonition, that it may the rather take place with vs, let vs conſider of the warnings which the holy Scriptures of God giue vs, againſt this moſt wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12614:98"/> both by precept, and by the diſcouerie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of thoſe, that haue wickedly practiſed the ſame. And ſo will we come to the puniſhment of this ſinne.</p>
               <p>For Precept of admonition againſt it, we may well call to mind, that which the Apoſtle ſetteth downe, Rom. ch. 12.17. &amp;c. and 1. Theſ. 5 15. where the holy Apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtruction of our Sauiour Chriſt, Matth. 5 44. chargeth all Chriſtians, to be ſo farre from recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing good with euill, that they ſhould not recompence one euill turne with another; but contrariwiſe, that they ſhould ouercome euill with goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>But that it doth not ſeldome fall out otherwiſe, it may appeare by the complaints of the ſeruants of God, againſt examples of contrary euil practiſe, and alſo by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>Of theſe euill examples of moſt vnthankfull practiſe, we haue the ſpeciall complaints of Iob, Dauid, &amp; the prophet Ieremie. Of Iobs complaint we read in the beginning of the 30. chap. of his booke. For after that he had proteſted his kind and mercifull courſe of life, all the time of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, as hath bene alleaged in the firſt part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, out of the 29. ch. he breaketh into this ſpeach: <hi>But now</hi> (ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th he) <hi>they that are yonger then I, mocke me: yea they, whoſe fathers I might haue diſpiſed to ſet with the dogges of my flocke,</hi> that is, to giue them a place among my poore ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and other heardmen, to haue part of that which they caſt to their dogges, &amp;c. And then it followeth, verſe. 9. &amp;c. <hi>Now I am their ſong, and I am their talke. They abhorre me, and flie farre from me, and ſpare not to ſpit in my face. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God hath looſed my coard, and humbled me, they haue looſed the bridle before me, &amp;c.</hi> This is the complaint of Iob.</p>
               <p>The complaint of Dauid is ſet downe in diuers places. Namely, Pſal. 7.4. where he ſaith, he was vexed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe of him whom he had deliuered. And Pſal, 35.12. <hi>They reward me euill for good, to haue ſpoyled my ſoule.</hi> He had
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:12614:99"/> not onely one ſuch a principall aduerſary, and as it were a ringleader or captaine, but he had many other, that ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with that chiefe aduerſarie againſt him, though they had no more iuſt cauſe to doe ſo, then their leader had. And Pſal. 38.20. <hi>They alſo that reward euill for good are mine aduerſaries, becauſe I follow goodneſſe.</hi> And Pſal. 109.4.5. <hi>For my friendſhip they were mine aduerſaries, but I gaue my ſelfe to prayer. And they haue rewarded mee euill for good, and hatred for my friendſhip.</hi> And Pſal. 120.7. <hi>I ſeeke peace, but when I ſpeake therof, they are bent to warre.</hi> Hetherto of the complaint of Dauid.</p>
               <p>Now, how the Prophet Ieremie complaineth againſt the ſame kind of moſt vnthankefull men, we read in his propheſie, chap. 18.20. And he putteth vp his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to God, appealing from ſuch vnequall aduerſaries to the moſt righteous Iudge. <hi>Shall euill be recompenced for good,</hi> ſaith the Prophet? <hi>For they haue digged a pitte for my ſoule: remember that I haue ſtood before thee to ſpeake good for them, and to turne away thy wrath from them.</hi> Where it is worthy to be marked, that Praier is reckned for a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit, to thoſe that are praied for, euen by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords high court of heauen; how lightly ſoeuer, they through their owne wickedneſſe, eſteeme of it, and fruſtrate the effect thereof. Such is the complaint of the Prophet Ierimiah. Whereby, together with the former complaints of Iob, and Dauid (they all beeing very good and mercifull men) we may perceiue what is the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnthankfulneſſe of the children of this world, againſt the children and ſeruants of God, who doe euerie way ſeeke to procure the greateſt and beſt good they can vnto them.</p>
               <p>But what is all this, in compariſone of that vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Iewes, to our Sauiour Chriſt, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; who notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he was infinitly, aboue all other, whether Dauid or Ierimiah, or anie other, or all, both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Kings, and Prieſts, moſt tender in all compaſſion,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12614:99"/> and moſt bounteous in the exerciſe of all goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and all men: they were neuertheleſſe moſt ingratefull, yea moſt malitious and ſpitefull againſt him to the death, as we ſaw from the 10. chap. of the Euangeliſt Iohn: and as the effect it ſelfe confirmed by experience, and moſt diueliſh practiſe in the end.</p>
               <p>And touching experience, who is it, euen to ſpeake ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that exerciſeth himſelfe in doing good, whether to the bodies, and outward ſtate of men, or to their ſoules, and true welfare thereof, ſpecially if they make that the end of all their kindneſſe, to drawe them from ſinne to faith and obedience to God, as all right good &amp; godly men do. Who hath not (I ſay) ſome vncomfortable experience of vnthankefulneſſe, yea of bad requital, at the hands of thoſe, whoſe benefit and ſaluation they ſeeke.</p>
               <p>The good vſe now, both of experience, and of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of vnthankefull perſons, muſt not be thereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the minds of any from dooing good, that their loue ſhould be quenched by the vnkinkneſſe, or hatred and malice of other: but according to thoſe former good examples of well doing (we looking principally to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariableneſſe of our Sauiour Chriſt in moſt conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of dooing the greateſt good, though he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited at the handes of the moſt part, with the moſt bitter and worſt requitall that might be) we alſo, euerie one in his meaſure, may confirme our ſelues in a good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull courſe againſt all offences whatſoeuer: yea though they doe at any time a riſe from ſuch, at whoſe hands we ſhould leaſt looke for them, euen ſuch as any haue reputed to bee moſt faithfully affected toward them. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the worke of all ſuch ſhalbe of ſpeciall account with the Lord; who aſſuredly, will ſo much the more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly requite the conſtant goodneſſe and mercie of his ſeruantes, by how much, they are worſe recompenced in this wicked world.

                     <p>Note alſo the ſin of vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe is great eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this, that in dſcourageth many from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the loue of many to waxe cold, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt teacheth, Matt. chap. 24.12.

                     <p>Wherefore not without cauſe haue euen the heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned vnthank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful perſons as common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the poore &amp; needy.</p>

               <p>Here, firſt of all, the holie Prouerb offereth it ſelfe, for a plaine and familiar confirmation. <hi>For he that rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euill for good</hi> (as ſaith King Salomon, ſpeaking by the holie Ghoſt) <hi>euill ſhall not depart from his houſe,</hi> chap. 17. verſe 13. And in that he maketh mention of the houſe of the vngratious or miſchieuous vnthankfull man, which is the higheſt degree of vnthankfulnes; it is more then if the holie Prouerb had affirmed, that euill ſhould reſt vpon his owne perſon alone. For hereby it is plaine, that in ſo much as vſuallie the wife, and children, and ſeruantes of the vnthankfull man, are wrapped in his ſinne: for naturallie we are all of vs vnthankfull, and will eaſilie be drawne into it: therfore they are partakers of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the maſter of the familie: vnles happilie, they ſhall by the grace of God, winde themſelues out of the guiltineſſe of his ſinne, like as that godlie wiſe Abigail and her ſeruantes did, from partaking with Nabal her husband in his ſinne; and ſo eſcaped the puniſhment, haſting toward them all by meanes of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to ſay no more of Nabal, that great and rich churle, ſaue onelie this, that in ſo much as Dauid bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his foure hundreth men in the wildernes of Paran, was verie good to the ſeruantes of Nabal, ſo that his men tooke nothing from them, but were as a wall of defence both night and day: thereupon Nabals owne ſeruants tell their Miſtreſſe, that they feared ſome euill would ſuerlie come vpon their Maſter, and vpon all his familie, becauſe of his churliſhneſſe: 1. Sam. 25. verſes 14.15. &amp;c. Let
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12614:100"/> vs take a further view of ſome other examples, how God hath puniſhed this wicked vnthankfulneſſe, and how alſo he hath armed and authoriſed manie menaces and threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt the ſame, which ſhall ſurelie, in their due times and ſeaſons, take place againſt all offenders, whether particular perſons, or whole people and nations.</p>
               <p>Our firſt example to this purpoſe, ſhall be the Egiptians; who becauſe they forgat that great preſeruation, which God gaue them by the hand of Ioſeph, againſt their ſeuen yeares of ſcarcitie, dearth and famine; and for that they dealt verie cruellie, againſt the people of Iſrael, for whoſe cauſe God vouchſafed to bleſſe them: they were afterward deſtroied, both they and their king, by the mightie and high hande of the Lord from heauen. And the rather, becauſe they deſpiſed the more gentle corrections of the Lord, whereby he called them to repentance, Exod. 1.8. &amp;c. and chap. 7. &amp;c. and ch. 14.16.</p>
               <p>The Ammonits, Moabits, &amp; Edomits, who were fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dealt withal by the people of Iſrael, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came out of the land of Egypt, and paſſed by them toward the land of Canaan: for according to the commandement of God, they did in nothing moleſt or annoy them: in ſo much as theſe people, notwithſtanding the fauour which Iſrael ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did afterward maliciouſly conſpire to make bloudy and cruell warre againſt Iſrael, they were for a iuſt reward, ouerthrowne and deſtroyed, one by the ſword of another, as is recorded in the holy ſtorie of K. Iehoſhaphat, who at the ſame time was king of Iudah. For the good king had prayed to God againſt them, amplifying the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their enterpriſe, from that former kindnes of Iſrael, though long before ſhewed to their anceſtors, as we reade 2. Chron. 20.10.11.12. in theſe words; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith king Iehoſhaphat, in his prayer againſt them) <hi>the children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Moab, and mount Seir, by whom thou wouldeſt not let Iſral go, when they came out of the land of Egypt: but they turned aſide from them and deſtroyed them not: Behold</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12614:101"/> king Iehoſhaphat) <hi>they reward vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnes to men.</note> 
                  <hi>in comming to caſt vs out of thine inheritance, which thou haſt cauſed vs to inherite. O our God, wilt thou not iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for there is no ſtrength in vs to ſtand before this great multitude that commeth againſt vs, neither do we know what to do: but our eyes are toward thee, &amp;c.</hi> Such was the prayer of the godly king: the effect of it is teſtified in the 20. verſe. <hi>The Lord layd ambuſhments againſt the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come againſt Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and they ſlewe one another.</hi> This iudgement fell vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe they went about to recompence euill for good, as king Iehoſhaphat alleaged before the Lord in his prayer a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame ſecond booke of Chron. 24. verſ. 22. &amp;c. Becauſe Ioaſh, king of Iudah, remembred not the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which Iehoiadah had done to him, but in a rage ſlew his ſonne: yea, and that alſo very vniuſtly, euen becauſe he had at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, rebuked both him &amp; the people for their ſinne: the Lord therefore very ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſent the hoſt of Aram againſt him, which deſtroyed all the princes of the people. Yea, though they came with a ſmall company of men, yet the Lord deliuered a very great armie of the people of Iudah into their hand, becauſe they had forſaken the Lord God of their fathers. A manifeſt proofe whereof was this, that they ſlew the Prophet of the Lord moſt outragiouſly and tumultuouſly, for doing his dutie, and that alſo euen in the Court of the Lords Temple: yea, albeit he was the ſonne of ſuch a one, in remembrance of whoſe ſpeciall goodnes toward them, and among them, they ought ſo much the rather to haue taken ſome pauſe and deliberation about the matter. The indignitie of this action containing in it ſo intollerable vnthankfulneſſe, both to God and man, and that euen in the face and preſence of his diuine Maieſtie, it cauſeth our Sauiour Chriſt mightily to inueigh againſt it, and other like dealing of the wicked, among the people of God, from time to time, Matt. 23.33. <hi>O ſeruants, ô generation of vipers</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12614:101"/> 
                  <hi>how ſhould ye eſcape the damnation of hell? wherefore, behold I ſend ye Prophets, and wiſe men, and Scribes, and of them ye will kill and crucifie; and of them will ye ſcourge in your Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and perſecute from citie to citie, that vpon you may come all the righteous bloud that was ſhed vpon the earth, from the bloud of Abel the righteous, vnto the bloud of Zacharias the ſonne of Barachias, whom ye ſlewe betweene the temple and the altar. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, I ſay vnto ye, all theſe things ſhall come vpon this generation, &amp;c.</hi> Among this bloud, thus vnrighteouſly ſhed, and among the examples of bloudy vnthankefulneſſe, and the iuſt reuenge thereof by the Lord; we may here take in the example of the Shechemites, of whom we read in the 9. ch. of the Iudges, who becauſe they ſhewed not kindneſſe to the children of Gideon, according to all that he had ſhewed vnto Iſrael, were grieuouſly puniſhed of God, by mutinous robbing and ſpoyling one of another. For God ſent an <hi>euill ſpirite betweene Abimelech, and the men of Shechem: and the men of Shechem brake their promiſe to Abimelech, that the crueltie toward the ſeuentie ſonnes of Ierubbaal, and their bloud might come and be layd vpon Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech their brother, which had ſlaine them, and vpon the men of Shechem who had ayded him to kill his brethren.</hi> Iudg, ch. 8.35. and ch. 9.23.24. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This example thus added to the reſt; let vs now, from that threatning of our Sauiour Chriſt. Matth, 23. againſt all requiters of goodneſſe with euill, proceede, to take alike view of ſome of the fearefull threatnings of God againſt the ſame kind of wicked men, as we finde them recorded in his holy word: which ſhall as certainely take effect in time to come, as any of thoſe iudgementes, which haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie bene performed, for the warning of all other, in the times already paſſed.</p>
               <p>Among theſe fearefull threatnings, determined againſt wicked and miſchieuous vnthankfull men, that which was alleaged out of the Prouerbes, many be here iuſtly called to mind againe: <hi>that euill ſhall not depart from his houſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12614:102"/> rewardeth euill for good.</hi> Prouerb 17.13. And to like purpoſe, may we remember the imprecation of the 109. Pſalme, once alleaged before: <hi>Set thou the wicked ouer him, &amp;c.</hi> Namely becauſe <hi>for friendſhip they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, rewarding euill for good &amp; hatred for friendſhip, &amp;c. And remembred not to ſhew mercie but perſecuted the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp;c.</hi> verſe. 4.5.6. &amp;c. As it followeth in many verſes of the Pſalme.</p>
               <p>The which fearefull, and (as it ſeemeth to carnall min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men) ouer harſh and bitter imprecation, it is no other then that which Dauid wiſheth euen againſt himſelfe, as well as againſt any other, if <hi>he had rewarded euill to him that had peace with him.</hi> For then (ſaith he) <hi>Let the enemie perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted my ſoule and take it: yea let him tread my life downe vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the duſt. Selah.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, let him lay it deepe in the duſt, I craue no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp;c. For he acknowlegeth, that he ſhould be worthy to looſe all protection of God, and to fall into the hands of his enemies, ſo as they might haue their full deſire in his vtter ouerthrowe.</p>
               <p>The like imprecation to that of the 109. Pſalme, we read likewiſe in the propheſie of Ieremiah, in the place before cited; where he putteth vp his complaint vnto God againſt thoſe which recompenſed him euill for good: for there, his imprecation followeth in this manner. <hi>Deliuer vp their children vnto famine, and let them drop away by the force of the ſword, and let their wiues be robbed of their children, and be widdowes: and let their huſbands be put to death, and let their young men be ſlaine by the ſword in battell, &amp;c.</hi> Ier. ch. 18.21. &amp;c. Theſe fearefull imprecations containe in them as fearefull threatnings, as they themſelues be. For ſeeing God hath by his holy ſpirit guided his ſeruants, as liuely and ſincere interpreters of his holy iuſtice herein, to ſet them downe: there is no doubt but they are ratified in heauen, for the perpetuall admonition and warning of all men to the end of the world, whoſoeuer will auoid that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12614:102"/> that is contained in them againſt this ſinne.</p>
               <p>Neither let any man flatter himſelfe, becauſe all this (as hath alſo bene obſerued before) is ſpoken againſt the height and extremitie of the ſinne of vnthankefulneſſe; as though negligence, or forgetfulneſſe, or miſapplying of beneficence, came not within the compaſſe of this curſe: for euen theſe ſinnes alſo, are with great ſeueritie condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God.</p>
               <p>In the newe Teſtament, the Apoſtle Iude hauing layd forth the greatneſſe of their ſinne, who (communicating in the holy beneficence and contributions of the Chriſtian Churches, and intruding themſelues for gueſtes in the loue-feaſtes) had no care to feede themſelues in the feare of God, and to liue as Chriſtians ought to doe: he ſheweth firſt, the greatneſſe of this ſinne, in that he ſaith, ſuch were ſpottes in their holy feaſtes, <hi>Cloudes without water carried about of the windes, corrupt trees without fruite, &amp;c.</hi> And then followeth the puniſhment, which the holie Ghoſt threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and pronounceth: <hi>To them is reſerued the blackeneſſe of darkeneſſe for euer.</hi> The like is ſayd of the Apoſtle Paul. 1. Tim. 5.12.13. concerning the young widdowes who abuſed the maintenance which they had by the Churches to idleneſſe, yea to prating and buſie medling, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now further, let vs reaſon thus againſt all kind of vnprofitable conſumers of Chriſtian beneficence; that in ſo much, as euen they who giue not any thing at all to holy vſes, are greatly puniſhed, although they be no ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious riflers and ſpoylers of Church goods: yea euen they that giue, if it be in hypocriſie, and not with an vpright heart, as we haue a memorable example in Ananias and Saphira his wife: for they were both puniſhed by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie and ſodaine death, which cauſed great feare to fall on all the Church, which were the beholders of it, &amp; on as many alſo as heard of it, Act. 5.1. &amp;c. 11. And ſeeing all that boaſt of greater liberalitie, then they do in truth performe ſuch as King Salomon, ſaith, <hi>doe boaſt of falſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12614:103"/> liberalitie,</hi> Prouerb. chap. 25. verſe 14. and ſo being moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of God, cannot ſcape vnpuniſhed, according to that of the Apoſtle, Gal. 6. <hi>As a man ſoweth, ſo ſhall he reape.</hi> In like maner, how ſhould we thinke, that he which receiueth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, that is, contrary to the vertues required to Chriſtian receiuing, neither hath care to vſe that beneficence Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly which he hath receiued: how can we thinke (I ſay) that ſuch a one ſhould not be ſubiect to the puniſhment? For doubtleſſe, it is no leſſe ſinne to vſe good things ill, then not to giue them well. Is it not as great a ſinne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a field of corne after it is ſowne, as Abſolom burnt vp Ioabs corne, 2. Sam. 14.30. as if Ioab had not cauſed it firſt to be ſowne? But I will not proſecute this point, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelfe, to all reaſonable men, as I ſuppoſe, euident &amp; plaine. Wherefore I come to make ſome vſe of it, and ſo drawe to an end of our Treatiſe, as one thereunto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the importunitie of other great and weightie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the Lord.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, I beſeech you (I ſpeake to all thoſe that are partakers of holy and Chriſtian beneficence) let vs thinke, earneſtly with our ſelues, and weigh the matter, as with equall ballance, in our owne conſciences before hand; what anie of vs ſhould anſwere to the Lord, if we ſhould behaue our ſelues ſo diſſolutely in the abuſe and miſpending thereof, that the Lord ſhould be prouoked to bring forth his ſeruants to witneſſe before his iudgement ſeat againſt vs: that although they had, for his ſake, fed vs, when we were hungry, refreſhed vs with drinke when we were drie and thirſty, clothed vs when we were naked, lodged vs when we were harbourleſſe, viſited vs when we were ſicke and in priſon: nay rather, if they ſhould be brought for witneſſes (as they might be touching ſome of vs,) that they had not onely, for the Lords ſake, kept vs from extreme pouertie and miſerie, preuented our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, &amp;c. but that they had fed vs deintily, clothed vs coſtly, lodged vs in ſoft bedding, and euery way tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12614:103"/> vs charily, for his ſake, if notwithſtanding all this, any of vs ſhould not be found carefull to ſerue the Lord, and ſo to reioyce the hearts of our nurſing-fathers and nurſing-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, anſwerable to their ſo precious and rare kindneſſe and bountie poured vpon vs. But much rather if we ſhould idly, profanely, and wickedly waſte all that holy prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as it were the Manna of heauen, which hath bene beſtowed vpon vs, to the diſhonour of the name of God, and to the griefe and diſcouragement of the hearts of our godly benefactors: let vs (I ſay) earneſtly bethinke our ſelues, what any of vs could anſwer in this caſe. Nay rather, as the truth is, let vs aſſure our ſelues, that whoſoeuer of vs, ſhall be found thus culpable, or much leſſe; that, out of all queſtion, we ſhould be altogether without anſwere, as men dumbe and vtterly ſpeechleſſe; euen like to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete and rude gueſt, that at the marriage feaſt of the Goſpell, in ſo much as he was found there without his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage garment, to the diſhonour of the feaſt. And ſo being ſpeechleſſe, and conuict in our owne conſciences, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable and ſacrilegious wickedneſſe, what might wee poſſibly looke for, but as at the commandement of the King and Lord of the feaſt, or of the Iudge ſitting vppon the throne of iudgement, to be taken and bound hand &amp; feete, and ſo to be caſt into vtter darkeneſſe, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth; which was the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement of God vpon the profane and rude gueſt, Matt. 22.11.12.13.</p>
               <p>O therefore, how much better; yea how much more bleſſed and happie ſhall it be, if according as God of his rich mercie, do make anie of vs partakers of his more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace &amp; fauor, in the inlarging of the tender bowels and compaſſion of his good and mercifull ſeruants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs; we ſhall through his grace awake and ſtirre vp our ſelues, and inlarge our heartes, yea, if we ſhall riſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning (as the holy Scriptures vſe to ſpeake) that we may ſpeedily and with all diligence indeuour after the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12614:104"/> performance of euerie good dutie, of true chriſtian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and thankfulnes both toward God and man, to euerie good beneficiall friend, and to the whole Church of God. For hereunto we are called, yea verie honorablie inuited, and as it were hyred. Hereby alſo are we made debtours to all, ſo far forth as God ſhall vouchſafe to open the doore vnto vs, and to giue vs anie bleſſed occaſion and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to perfourme anie good and right ſeruiceable dutie. Thus dooing, we ſhall be ſo far from the diſpleaſing and diſhonouring of God; and ſo farre alſo, from the reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and damnable blot of vnthankfulneſſe, that we ſhall giue God double honour: firſt, in the acknowledgment of his mercie, as it were reached forth, by his owne moſt gratious and diuine hand, out of that fountain and treaſurie of all holie and ſacred beneficence, which is onelie with him and from him: and ſecondlie, we ſhall honour his diuine Maieſtie, in the worke of his ſpeciall grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he cauſeth his owne image &amp; glorious vertues to ſhine and caſt forth the comfortable beames thereof, from the mercifull affection and liberall actions of his deare childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Further alſo, thus doing, we ſhall giue incouragement to thoſe that are beneficially and liberally minded, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their liberalitie: yea, (as they ſhall increaſe in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to increaſe their well doing toward many, when they ſhal behold it to be wel beſtowed. And, finally thus doing, do we not ſee that euen in the receiuing, we our ſelues doo giue? we giue God his glorie, and we giue his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtrumentes that which is their due: yea, we giue our ſelues, &amp; all that God hath giuen vs, to God &amp; his Church; which are the only right endes wherefore God hath giuen vs that which we are, and all whatſoeuer we do enioy.</p>
               <p>So that although it ſtandeth firme as mount Sion, which our Sauiour Chriſt hath affirmed, that it is a bleſſed thing to giue and diſtribute benefites, rather then to receiue them: yet ſeeing in receiuing as we ought to receiue, we do giue againe that which we ought to giue: if we ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
